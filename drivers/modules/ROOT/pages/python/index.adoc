[#_install_python]
== Install

See the
<<_version_compatibility>> table to check what versions of TypeDB and Python driver are compatible.

Supported Python versions: from `3.9` to `3.13`.
For Linux: the minimum version of `glibc` is `2.25.0`.

To install TypeDB Python driver:

[source,console]
----
pip install typedb-driver
----

[#_check_install_python]
== Checking your installation

You should be able to import the TypeDB driver as follows:

[,python]
----
import typedb.driver
----

[NOTE]
====
On Windows, the import may fail with `ImportError: DLL load failed`. If it does, it means your system is missing the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable matching your Python version. To fix the issue, link:https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads[download and install the package].
====

== Quickstart

See below an example of Python code that connects to a local TypeDB server,
creates a database, processes driver errors, defines a schema, inserts some data, and then reads that data.

// TODO: Can we somehow import the example from `typedb-driver/python`, which is produced in `core_example`?
