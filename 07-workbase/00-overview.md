## What is Workbase?
The Grakn Workbase, along with the [Grakn Console](../02-console/01-console.md) and the [Grakn Clients](../03-client-api/00-overview.md), is an interface through which we can read from a Grakn knowledge graph.
Workbase allows us to execute Graql [`match`](../11-query/01-match-clause.md) queries, and visualise and investigate their results.
Whether you need a tool to test and experiment with your newly created Grakn knowledge graph, or that you prefer a graphical interface for reading data from Grakn, you will find Workbase extremely useful.

## Download Workbase
Grakn Workbase is available for Linux, Mac and Windows. Head over to the [Download Center](https://grakn.ai/download#workbase) to download and install the latest release of Workbase.

In the sections that follow, we learn how to [connect](../07-workbase/01-connection.md) Workbase with the Grakn Server, execute and [visualise](../07-workbase/02-visualisation.md) queries, interact with the visualiser to [investigate](../07-workbase/03-investigation.md) the results and use the [schema designer](../07-workbase/04-schema-designer.md).
