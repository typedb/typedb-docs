## What's covered?

In the following three sections, we tegether:

1. Define the [schema](../08-examples/01-phone-calls-schema.md) for our `phone_calls` knowledge graph
2. Migrate csv, json or xml data to the knowledge graph using clients [Java](../08-examples/02-phone-calls-migration-java.md), [Node.js](../08-examples/03-phone-calls-migration-nodejs.md) and [Python](../08-examples/04-phone-calls-migration-python.md)
3. [Query](../08-examples/05-phone-calls-queries.md) the knowledge graph

## What's the knowledge graph we are going to work on?

The knowledge graph we be working on in these series is called `phone_calls` and contains a dataset of **people** who **call** each other. Those who make calls have a **contract** with a **company**.
