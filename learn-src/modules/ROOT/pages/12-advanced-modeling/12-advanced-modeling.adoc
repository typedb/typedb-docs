= Lesson 12: Advanced modeling

== Overview

In this lesson, we'll learn how to use the PERA model to design TypeDB schemas that eliminate mismatch with application models. We'll begin by reviewing the fundamentals of the *entity-centric framework* of the PERA model, and how PERA types can be mapped onto to OOP types using the *type-theoretic framework*. We'll then have a close look at using relations in this framework, and learn about the *reification* and *de-reification* processes. Finally, we'll see how we can implement design by contract as a schema design strategy using *interface contracts*.

The application classes featured in this lesson are written in Python.
