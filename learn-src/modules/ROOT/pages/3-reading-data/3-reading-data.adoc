= Lesson 3: Reading data

== Overview

In this lesson, we'll learn how to read pre-inserted data in the sample database using *Fetch queries*. We'll begin by seeing how we can retrieve *entities* and *relations* in a similar way to how we do with relational databases. We'll then see how we can retrieve data in unique ways using TypeDB: by writing declarative *polymorphic* queries, by leveraging *rule inference*, and by retrieving *types* from the schema. Finally, we'll look at a few examples of *type inference* at work by seeing how TypeDB validates queries.
