= Lesson 2: Environment setup

In this lesson, we'll set up the environment needed to work through this course. We'll begin by downloading and running a *Docker image* that will deploy a *TypeDB Core server* preloaded with a *sample database*. Then, we'll install *TypeDB Studio*, which we'll be using to manage databases and execute queries. We'll also go through a quick tutorial to get an overview of the key features of Studio that we'll need throughout this course.

== Recommended prerequisites

* You may want to read through xref:learn::1-why-typedb/1-why-typedb.adoc[Lesson 1] before starting this lesson if you are unfamiliar with TypeDB.
