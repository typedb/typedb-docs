= Lesson 10: Using inference

== Overview

In this lesson, we'll learn how to write and use rules effectively. We'll start by seeing how rules can be used like views in order to *abstract complex query patterns* into more maintainable forms. Then we'll explore how we can use rules to build networks of logic, covering *rule chaining* and *rule branching*, allowing us to create complex behaviour from simple rules. As part of this, we'll also examine *rule recursion*.
