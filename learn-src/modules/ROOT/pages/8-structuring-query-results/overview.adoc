= Lesson 8: Structuring query results
:page-aliases: learn::8-structuring-query-results/8-structuring-query-results.adoc
:page-preamble-card: 1

In this lesson, we'll learn how we can modify our queries to retrieve results in more useful and efficient structures. We'll see how we can *directly retrieve attributes*, how we can use *subqueries* to group results and perform *aggregations*, and finally how we can *sort* and *paginate* the results returned.

== Recommended prerequisites
