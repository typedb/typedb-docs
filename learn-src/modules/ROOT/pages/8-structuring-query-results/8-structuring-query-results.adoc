= Lesson 8: Structuring query results

== Overview

In this lesson, we'll learn how we can modify our queries to retrieve results in more useful and efficient structures. We'll see how we can *directly retrieve attributes*, how we can use *subqueries* to group results and perform *aggregations*, and finally how we can *sort* and *paginate* the results returned.
