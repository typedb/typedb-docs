= Lesson 7: Understanding query patterns

== Overview

In this lesson, we'll learn advanced aspects of building query patterns. We'll begin by examining how TypeDB resolves patterns against the schema as *constraint satisfaction* problems. We'll then examine some specific syntax elements we can use in patterns, including *advanced relation patterns*, *logical operators*, *value comparisons*, and *value expressions*. Finally, we'll study the semantics of *solution sets*, to understand how the number of times a pattern is matched can affect the results of read and write queries.
