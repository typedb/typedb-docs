= Lesson 5: Defining schemas

== Overview

In this lesson, we'll learn how to define entity, relation, and attribute types using *Define queries*. We'll start by defining individual *types* and their interfaces, namely *ownership interfaces* for attributes and *role interfaces* for relations. We'll then see how we can define *type hierarchies* for entities, relations, and attributes. We'll also see how we can apply different kinds of *value constraints* to attributes and define *rules* to infer new data. Finally, we'll see how TypeDB validates changes to the schema to ensure it stays in a consistent state.
