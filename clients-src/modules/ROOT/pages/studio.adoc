TypeDB Studio is an IDE specifically designed for TypeDB databases and
TypeDB's query language -- xref:typeql::fundamentals.adoc[TypeQL,window=_blank].

It has unique set of functions and abilities to help with development using TypeDB:

* Friendly GUI to design schemas and queries for TypeDB databases.
* Syntax highlighting for TypeQL.
* Connection to TypeDB servers, including handling transactions.
* Type Browser for exploring types in a TypeDB database.
* Query execution, including schema and data, read and write transactions.
* Local query validation with constraints of an actual database schema before sending the query to server.
* Graph visualization for query responses.

[#_installation]
== Installation

=== Requirements

TypeDB Studio do not require any additional packages to be installed prior the installation, but it needs a TypeDB
server to perform most it's functions. We can use either remote or local TypeDB server.

[NOTE]
====
The default TypeDB settings are to run server listening for `localhost` connections with port number `1729`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
We recommend using the latest version of TypeDB server and a
xref:clients::studio.adoc#_version_compatibility[compatible] version of TypeDB Studio.
====

[#_download_install]
=== Download & install

Download TypeDB distributive/package for any popular OS family from the
xref:clients:resources:downloads.adoc#_typedb_studio[Download page].

Follow proper installation procedure of the OS in use.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to grant access for installation wizard to install TypeDB Studio in case any security prompts will appear.
====

[NOTE]
====
For **macOS** TypeDB Studio can be installed via homebrew (not recommended for `AArch64` architecture):

[,bash]
----
brew tap vaticle/tap
brew install --cask vaticle/tap/typedb-studio
----
====

== Prepare for work

Right after starting TypeDB Studio we can see its main window as it is shown below.

image::studio/studio-gui.png[TypeDB Studio GUI, width = 70%, link=self]

The main panels of the GUI are marked with the following numbers on the image above:

. Projects panel
. Type browser
. Text editor tab
. Toolbar

To use most of TypeDB Studio functions we need to connect to a TypeDB server and choose a project directory.

[#_connect_to_typedb_server]
=== Connect to TypeDB server

At the top right-hand corner click the btn:[Connect to TypeDB] button. It will open a windows with the same name and
the connection settings as shown below.

image::studio/connection-interface-disconnected.png[Connection Manager Disconnected, width = 70%, link=self]

Fill in the address of the TypeDB server. By default, it's: `localhost:1729`. Click the btn:[Connect] button.

image::studio/connection-interface-connected.png[Connection Manager Connected, width = 70%, link=self]

Once TypeDB Studio connected to a TypeDB server successfully, the connection manager window should close automatically.
If we reopen the window we can find the green status field in the bottom left corner, as shown above.

[NOTE]
====
When Studio connected to a TypeDB server it will display the server address in the top right corner instead of the
label of the `Connect to TypeDB` button.
====

=== Disconnect from TypeDB server

At the top right-hand corner click the button with the server address in it.

In the `Connect to TypeDB` window click on the btn:[Disconnect] button.

[#_create_a_database]
=== Create a database

To create a new database make sure TypeDB Studio is connected to a TypeDB server and click on the
btn:[Manage Databases] button (with a database icon) as shown below.

image::studio/studio-database.png[Database icon]

Enter the name for the new database at the text field at the bottom of the `Manage Databases` window and hit
btn:[Create].

image::studio/databases-interface-iam-database.png[Database Manager with IAM database, 300, link=self]

Our database appeared at the list of databases. Now we can close the `Manage Databases` window by clicking the
btn:[Close] button.

[#_select_active_database]
=== Select active database

TypeDB Studio lets us work with one database at a time. Thus, to perform any query we need to choose a database
first.

We can select it by clicking the dropdown menu at the *Toolbar* titled btn:[database (none)] or with a name of
previously selected database. It is the only dropdown menu in the *Toolbar* and is located immediately right of the
databases icon.

[NOTE]
====
If the dropdown menu isn't active it usually means that we didn't connect to a server yet.
====

After selecting the database to work with from a list, we will see it's name on the dropdown list and types
hierarchy of the selected database in the <<_types_browser_capabilities,Type browser>> (bottom left of the screen).

[#_open_a_project_directory]
=== Open a project directory

TypeDB Studio stores queries we save on a local machine in a project directory, so we don't need to rewrite all queries
each time we open Studio. To select a project directory click on the open folder icon left of the database icon or
click on the btn:[Open Project] button in the *Projects* panel on the left (under the database icon).

image::studio/project-interface-open.png[Project Interface Prompt to Open]

[NOTE]
====
If the *Projects* panel is not displayed -- click the *Projects* vertical tab on the left edge of the TypeDB Studio window.
====

== Basic operations

=== File operations

[#_create_a_new_file]
==== Create a new file

To create a new file use the button with the plus (`+`) icon. It is located at the top of the *Text editor* panel
under the *Toolbar*. It's horizontal position adjusted for the number of tabs opened in the *Text editor* -- the
button with plus icon will always stay at the right end of the tabs of the *Text editor*.

Upon clicking on the plus button a new tab will be opened with the default filename. For new files by default
filename consists of `Untitled` word, followed by a number, starting from `1` and a file extension of `.tql`.

image::studio/project-new-file.png[Create a New File, width = 70%, link=self]

This file will be stored at the hidden folder in the current project directory until it will be saved with some
other name and path.

[#_open_an_existing_file]
==== Open an existing file

We can open any existing file in the current project directory by double-clicking on the file in the
*Projects* panel. It will create a new tab in the *Text editor* panel with the contents of the file.

If there is already a tab with the file opened it will become active instead of creating a new one.

==== Save a file

Any file edited in the *Text editor* panel is auto saved with a small delay. That includes new files that wasn't
assigned a specific name yet. Those are saved into the hidden folder with their default names. That way if we close
TypeDB Studio the all files will be persisted and upon starting the Studio again all files in the hidden folder will
be opened automatically.

Upon manual save those Untitled files will be saved with the specified filename and path and deleted from the hidden
folder.

To save file manually use the btn:[Save Current File] (floppy disk 💾 icon) button at the left end of the *Toolbar*.

=== Query design

One of the most important functions of TypeDB Studio is to provide an environment to design and debug queries to
TypeDB databases. For that we have the *Text editor* panel with TypeQL syntax highlighting and the *Toolbar*
with transaction controls.

[#_text_editor_panel]
==== Text editor panel

*Text editor* panel doesn't have a visible title, but it's the biggest area in the middle of the TypeDB Studio +
that is being used to work with text information. It does have tabs at the top to switch between different opened files.

The currently selected file's content displayed in the main section with line numbers at the left edge of the
*Text editor* panel.

All text in the *Text editor* panel will be displayed with TypeQL syntax highlighting.

In the bottom right corner of TypeDB Studio window there is an indicator for cursor location that contains the line
number and current symbol position in that line.

//#todo rewrite from being descriptive to a proper documenting Studio functions

The following functions can be activated from the context menu available by right-clicking inside the *Text editor*
main section:

* Copy/Cut/Paste
* Find/Replace
* Run File/Run Selection
* Increase/Decrease/Reset Text Size

=== Query execution

To <<_run_query,run>> a query that we have prepared in a tab of the <<_text_editor_panel>>,
use the <<_transaction_control, transaction controls>> in the top *Toolbar*.

[#_run_query]
==== How to run a query

Make sure TypeDB Studio is <<_connect_to_typedb_server,connected>> to a TypeDB server,
database is <<_select_active_database,selected>> and project directory is <<_open_a_project_directory,opened>>.

. Make sure the query to run is open in the active tab of the text-editor panel. +
If it's not the case: <<_create_a_new_file,write a new one>> or <<_open_an_existing_file,open an existing>> file
with query to run.
+
image::studio/project-schema-pasted.png[Query text, width = 70%, link=self]

. Choose the correct xref:typedb::development/connect.adoc#_sessions[session,window=_blank] (`schema`/`data`) type and
  xref:typedb::development/connect.adoc#_transactions[transaction,window=_blank] (`read`/`write`) type to run the query
  by clicking on those options on the *Toolbar* switches.
. Run the query by clicking on the btn:[Run Query] (▶) button. +
*Run* panel will be expanded on the bottom of the query to show the results of the query execution attempt.
+
image::studio/project-schema-query-run.png[Write the Schema, width = 70%, link=self]

. If it's the `write` transaction type -- wait for transaction control options to be ready and commit or close the
transaction (by clicking on the btn:[Commit transaction] (✔) or btn:[Close transaction] (x) buttons respectively).

The result of the query is displayed in the *Run* panel under the Text editor.

If any error occurs during the query validation or transaction it is shown as red popup in the bottom right corner of
the TypeDB Studio window. Additional information about the error is displayed in the results of the query in the
*Run* panel.

If a `write` transaction committed successfully -- a blue pop-up with a transaction confirmation is displayed.
See example below.

image::studio/project-schema-committed.png[Commit the Transaction, width = 70%, link=self]

For more information on different control elements for query execution, see the <<_transaction_control>> section below.

[#_results]
==== How to see results

Under the *Text editor* panel there is the *Run* panel, but it is collapsed by default if no query has been run yet.

To expand it perform any query or just click on the upwards-pointing chevron in the bottom right corner of
TypeDB Studio window, above the cursor location indicator.

*Run* panel has 2 sets tabs:

* Tabs at the top of the *Run* panel are for different query attempts.
+
By default, every query sent will overwrite the existing tab, but if we enable the pin icon at the beginning
of the tab name by clicking it -- the tab will become pinned and stay. A new tab will appear on the right from
the last pinned one upon next query execution.

* Tabs at the bottom of the *Run* panel are for different results for the currently selected query attempt (tab
at the top of the *Run* panel). These include the `Log` tab with direct textual Studio output and the `Graph`
tabs (one per every query statement in the *Text editor* panel) with graph visualization of response.

Use `Log` tab to see textual output from the query execution (including error and query execution messages)
// #todo add Log tab section and Graph visualization section with preview panel description -

[#_transaction_control]
=== Transaction controls

To control query execution we have the top *Toolbar* elements located to the right from the database selection
drop-down menu. See below.

image::studio/studio-transaction-controls.png[Transaction controls, link=self]

From left to right (numbered respectively to the screenshot numbers):

. xref:typedb::development/connect.adoc#_sessions[Session] type switch:
 ** `schema` -- to use schema session type
 ** `data` -- to use data session type
. xref:typedb::development/connect.adoc#_transactions[Transaction] type switch:
 ** `write` -- to use write transaction
 ** `read` -- to use read transaction
. btn:[snapshot] button -- enables snapshot feature that encapsulates transaction in a snapshot of a database's data
until the transaction committed or closed. Write transactions are always snapshoted. May be enabled or disabled
for read transactions.
. btn:[infer] button -- enable xref:typedb::/development/infer.adoc[inferring data] by rules. Only available for read
transactions.
. btn:[explain] button -- enable xref:typedb::development/infer.adoc#_explain_query[explanations] mechanics by providing
`explainables` methods for results. Only available for read transactions with *snapshot* and *infer* enabled.
. btn:[Transaction status] (Circle (●) icon) indicator -- transaction activity indicator. Green if there is a
transaction opened by TypeDB Studio at this moment. Gray if there is no opened transaction. Rotating animation --
TypeDB Studio processing the query or the results (including additional API calls).
. btn:[Close transaction] (x icon) button -- close active transaction without committing the results.
. btn:[Rollback transaction] (U-turn (⟲) icon) button -- revert the transaction results without closing it.
. btn:[Commit transaction] (Tick (✔) icon) button -- commit the changes and close the transaction.
. btn:[Run Query] (play (▶) icon) button -- run query or queries in the active tab of the *Text editor* panel.
It will open a transaction (with the session type and transaction type specified in the *Toolbar* on the left)
and execute the TypeQL code against the selected database.
. btn:[Stop Signal] (lighting (⚡) icon) button -- stop query execution after the next result.

[#_inference]
== Inference

To run a query with inference, simply switch the inference option *on* before executing a query.

The xref:typedb::fundamentals/inference.adoc[inference] transaction option can be switched *on* and *off* with
the btn:[infer] button in the top *Toolbar*.

[NOTE]
====
If the btn:[infer] button is inactive, double-check the following prerequisites are met:

- there is an active database <<_connect_to_typedb_server,connection>>;
- there is a database <<_select_active_database,selected>>;
- the transaction type is set to *read*.
====

As a result of running a query with inference we can get <<_results,results>> in the *Run* panel. If there are any
inferred instances of data they will be shown with green lining in the graph visualization. And inferred connections
(ownerships or roles played) will be shown as green arrows. See the example below.

[#_inference_results]
image::clients::studio/inference.png[Inference results example, width = 70%, link=self]

[#_explanation]
=== Explanation

To run a query with explanation, simply switch the explanation option *on* before executing a query. To be able to do
that the inference and the snapshot options must also be enabled.

The xref:typedb::development/infer.adoc#_explain_query[explanation] transaction option can be switched
*on* and *off* with the btn:[explain] button in the top *Toolbar*. The inference and snapshot options can be enabled
by the btn:[infer] and the btn:[snapshot] buttons respectively.

[NOTE]
====
If the btn:[explain] button is inactive, double-check the following:

- the btn:[infer] button is *on*;
- the btn:[snapshot] button is *on*;
- there is an active database <<_connect_to_typedb_server,connection>>;
- there is a database <<_select_active_database,selected>>;
- the transaction type is set to *read*.
====

As a result of running a query with inference and explanation options we can get <<_results,results>> in the
*Run* panel. If there are any inferred instances of data they will be shown with green lining in the graph
visualization. And inferred connections (ownerships or roles played) will be shown as green arrows. As it was shown
in the <<_inference_results,inference example>> above.

The only difference is -- double-clicking on any explainable inferred results will spawn an explanation. An explanation
is a set of additional instances and connections, that provide a direct explanation of the selected explainable inferred
result. See the example below.

[#_explanation_results]
image::clients::studio/explanation.png[Explanation example, width = 70%, link=self]

[#_types_browser_capabilities]
== Type browser capabilities

Under the *Projects* panel that shows the project directory TypeDB has *Type Browser* panel that shows all types of
the schema of the current database.

[NOTE]
====
If the *Type Browser* panel is not displayed -- click the *Type Browser* vertical tab on the left edge of the
TypeDB Studio window.
====

All types are divided in three top level xref:typedb::fundamentals/types.adoc#_type[built-in types]:

* Attribute
* Entity
* Relation

In an empty database (without a schema) only these three built-in types shown in the panel.

In a database with a schema all types displayed in the exact hierarchy they were created (subtypes inside their
supertypes). We can easily collapse or expand all the types in the structure tree by clicking the associated buttons
on the top of the *Type Browser* panel with double chevrons (arrow heads) pointing down or up respectively.

image::studio/type-browser.png[Type browser,width=300, link=self]

Double-clicking on any type will open the <<_type_editor,Type editor>> with information about the selected type
in a tab of the *Text editor*.

*Type Browser* panel can be closed by clicking the *X* icon in the top right corner of the panel. To reopen the panel
click the *Type Browser* tab on the left edge of the TypeDB Studio window.

=== Export schema

We can export schema of the database by clicking the btn:[Export Schema Types] button (second in row from left to
right) on the top of the *Type Browser* panel. It creates a new tab with inserted TypeQL code that creates the exact
schema that is in the current database.

[WARNING]
====
The btn:[Export Schema Types] button doesn't include rules into its output. That will be fixed in some of the next
versions of the TypeDB Studio.
====

[#_type_editor]
=== Type editor

By double-clicking any type we can open the type editor window that shows all information about the selected type and
allows us to easily edit the type.

image::studio/type-editor.png[Types editor, width = 70%, link=self]

We can rename the type, change its supertype, abstract property, see all the connected types (subtypes, owned
attributes or owners of this particular attribute, related and played roles).

By clicking on one of the connected types we can see all information about it as well.

=== Rename a type

[WARNING]
====
For the renaming functions to be active set the session type switch to the `schema` and transaction type switch to the
`write` options first.
====

In TypeDB Studio we can rename a type in two ways:

* Open the type editor window by double-clicking on the type. At the very top click on the pencil icon immediately
right from the type name. Edit the name in the Label field and press btn:[Rename] button to finalize.
* Right-click on the type in the *Type browser* list. Click on the *Rename Type* option. Edit the name in the Label
field and press btn:[Rename] button to finalize.

[NOTE]
====
Renaming a type in any of this two ways will update the relevant type references in the schema and will not lead
to loosing existing data. All existing instances of the type will be available under the new types name.
====

=== Delete a type

[WARNING]
====
For the deleting functions to be active set the session type switch to the `schema` and transaction type switch to
the `write` options first.
====

In TypeDB Studio we can delete a type in two ways:

* Open the type editor window by double-clicking on the type. At the very bottom click on the btn:[Delete] button and
press btn:[Confirm] button. Commit the transaction with the green tick at the top of the Studio window.
* Right-click on the type in the *Type browser* list. Click on the Delete option and press btn:[Confirm] button. Commit
the transaction with the green tick at the top of the Studio window.

[NOTE]
====
In some cases the btn:[Delete] option and button can be disabled. That means there are some conditions that prevent us
from deleting this type.

For example, we can't xref:typedb::development/schema.adoc#_undefine_subtype[delete a type that has a subtype].
====

== Settings

To configure TypeDB Studio open the *Manage Preferences* window by clicking on the button with the gear (⚙) icon
in the top right corner of the TypeDB Studio window.

TypeDB Studio has the following settings available:

* Graph Visualiser
** Enable Graph Output -- Turns on visualization of query results as graphs on a separate tab of the *Run* panel. +
Default value: *On*.
* Project Manager
** Set Ignored Paths -- All paths mentioned here will be invisible in any Project directory opened in Studio. +
Default value: `.git`.
* Query Runner
** Default Get Query Limit -- Limits the maximum number of results to be returned from a get query to a database
if no limit explicitly stated in the query. +
Default value: *1000*.
* Text Editor
** Enable Autosave -- Enables autosave function for files opened in TypeDB Studio. +
Default value: *On*.
