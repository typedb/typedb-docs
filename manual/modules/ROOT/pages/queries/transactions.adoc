== Transactionality

TypeDB transactions come in 3 flavors: *read*, *write*, and *schema* transactions. All transactions operate over *snapshots* of the database, providing a consistent view regardless of the operations performed in concurrent transactions.

TypeDB transactions provide *ACID guarantees* up to snapshot isolation.

== Read transactions

Read transactions can execute only read queries, and will error when provided data update queries or schema mutation queries.

* They are the most lightweight and should be used whenever possible.
* *Any number of read transactions can be opened concurrently*, and they
will never fail to open even when write or schema transactions are open.

== Write transactions

Write transactions can execute read queries and data update queries, and will error when provided schema mutation queries.

* Write transactions can be opened concurrently to other write transactions and read transactions.
* Write transactions *may fail on commit*, as required to enforce data consistency and isolation, such as when two write transactions concurrently update same piece of data and commit.

.Example of conflicting writes
[caption=""]
====
1. We open transaction 1 and modify the owned attribute of an entity.

2. We then open transaction 2 before transaction 1 has been committed, and modify the same ownership.

3. If we commit first transaction 1, then transaction 2, the commit of transaction 2 will fail.
====

== Schema transactions

Schema transactions can execute any type of query: read, data update, and schema mutation queries. They thus _subsume_ the previous two transaction types.

* Schema transactions are *exclusive* both against other schema transactions and write transactions. Existing open write transactions will block schema transactions from opening. Similarly, a schema transaction will block write transactions from opening.
This prevents the data from mutating while the schema is being updated.

* Schema transactions can *mutate both data and schema* at the same time, allowing atomic migrations from one database state to another.

== Executing queries in transaction

All transactions types have an identical API to submit queries.

====
Studio::
+
--
Select your database using the database selector (image:{page-component-version}@home::studio-icons/database-none.png[width=128]), then
select your transaction type in the top menu.

Open your query file.
Run the query by clicking the image:{page-version}@home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[Run Query] button.
Finally, use the commit button (image:{page-version}@home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24]) to persist any changes made.
--

Console::
+
--
Open the transaction with

----
transaction my-db <TYPE>
----

where `<TYPE>` can be one of `schema`, `write`, or `read`.

Then run your queries in the newly opened prompt, using enters for newlines and double enters for query submissions.
Use

----
commit
----

if you want to commit changes, or press kbd:[Ctrl+C] (interrupt) or kbd:[Ctrl+D] (end of input) to terminate the transaction without
committing.
--

Python::
+
--
Open a transaction and send a query with

[,python,indent=0]
----
with driver.transaction(<DATABASE NAME>, TransactionType.<TYPE>) as transaction:
    answer = transaction.query(<QUERY>).resolve()
----

where:

- `<QUERY>` and `<DATABASE NAME>` are `str` s.
- `<TYPE>` can be one of `SCHEMA`, `WRITE`, or `READ`.

Use

[,python,indent=0]
----
transaction.commit()
----

if you want to commit changes.
--

Rust::
+
--
Open a transaction and send a query with

[,rust,indent=0]
----
let transaction = driver.transaction(<DATABASE NAME>, TransactionType::<TYPE>).await.unwrap();
{
    let answer = transaction.query(<QUERY>).await.unwrap();
}
----

where:

- `<QUERY>` and `<DATABASE NAME>` are `&str` s.
- `<TYPE>` can be one of `Schema`, `Write`, or `Read`.

Use

[,rust,indent=0]
----
    transaction.commit().await.unwrap();
----

if you want to commit changes.
--

Java::
+
--
Open a transaction and send a query with

[,java,indent=0]
----
 try (TypeDBTransaction transaction = session.transaction(<DATABASE NAME>, Transaction.Type.<TYPE>)) {
     transaction.query(<QUERY>).resolve();
 }
----

where:

- `<QUERY>` and `<DATABASE NAME>` are `String` s.
- `<TYPE>` can be one of `SCHEMA`, `WRITE`, or `READ`.

Use

[,java,indent=0]
----
transaction.commit();
----

if you want to commit changes.
