== The server does not start with error `version 'GLIBC_2.25' not found`

TypeDB for Linux currently requires glibc v2.25 or later. Updating your Linux distribution may resolve this issue.

Supported versions of some popular Linux distributions:

* Debian 10 buster or newer,
* Ubuntu 17.10 artful or newer,
* RHEL-8.10 or newer,
* Fedora 26 or newer,
* CentOS 8.5 or newer,
* Amazon Linux 2,
* Amazon Linux 2023.

If your distribution is not listed above, you can consult https://distrowatch.com/[DistroWatch.com] to find out if
the newest version ships with glibc >=2.25.

TIP: Alpine Linux does not ship with glibc by default. Additional setup is required to run TypeDB server on Alpine Linux.
