== Create a sample deployment

Log in to https://cloud.typedb.com/[TypeDB Cloud,window=_blank] and create a new deployment on the deployments page. When prompted to choose a sample dataset, choose the `{sample-dataset-name}` dataset.

== Connect to your deployment

In this guide, we use *TypeDB Studio*, the standalone graphical tool for working with TypeDB. Ensure Studio is xref:{page-component-version}@manual::install/studio.adoc[installed], then launch the application. To connect to your deployment:

include::{page-component-version}@manual::setup/studio.adoc[tag=connect_cloud_studio]

== Create a project

include::{page-component-version}@manual::setup/studio.adoc[tag=select_project]

== Select the sample database

Select the `{sample-dataset-name}` database you created earlier from the btn:[Select Database] dropdown (image:{page-component-version}@home::studio-icons/database-none.png[]) in the top toolbar.
