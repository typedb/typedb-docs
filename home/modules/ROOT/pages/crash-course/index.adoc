:summary: Learn about schema definitions and data operations in TypeDB.

The TypeDB crash course will give you a concise overview of the main aspects of working with TypeDB and TypeQL. For a more in-depth introduction, check out xref:academy::index.adoc[TypeDB Academy].

== Introduction

The TypeDB crash course is divided into two sections: the environment setup, followed by a choice of pathways. Follow the instructions on this page to quickly set up the environment you'll need for the crash course. At the end of this page, choose the pathway that most closely matches your previous database experience:

* *New database users*: Pathway for those completely new to databases.
* *Relational database users*: Pathway for those used to working with relational databases.
// * *Document database users*: Pathway for those used to working with document databases.
* *Graph database users*: Pathway for those used to working with graph databases.

== Running queries

To run a query:

. Make sure you are using the correct *session type* and *transaction type*. You can change these using the session type toggle (image:manual::icons/session-schema.png[]) and transaction type toggle (image:manual::icons/transaction-write.png[]) in the top toolbar. The course material will tell you which session and transaction type to use for each query, but you can also refer to the following table.
+
[cols="^.^,^.^,^.^",caption="",options="header"]
|===
| Session type | Transaction type | Query types
| `schema` | `write` | Define
| `data` | `write` | Insert, Delete, Update
| `data` | `read` | Fetch, Get
|===

. Open a image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_new.svg[width=24] btn:[New Tab] in the btn:[Text Editor] and paste in the query.
. Click the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[Run Query] button.
. If the transaction is a `write` transaction: when the query has completed, click image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit Transaction]. The course material will tell you when this is necessary.
