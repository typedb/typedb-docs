= Editing Guide
:keywords: typedb, docathon
:pageTitle: HTML title
:summary: This page is about editing the docs.

(This text, before the first heading, is called the "preamble" and introduces the page.)

== What is this guide?

This guide walks you through the basics of editing `.adoc` files.

== File structure

Top-level folders (`home`, `manual`, `academy`, ...) are the *component* of our docs. Each modules has subfolder `modules/ROOT` called the `ROOT` of the module (in theory it could have other submodules ... but we don't use non-trivial modules, everything is in the `ROOT` module of the component).

* The pages of the module are in `ROOT/pages`
* "Partially included" pages are in `ROOT/partials`
* Images are in `ROOT/images`
* Code example are in `ROOT/examples`
* **Runnable** TypeQL code examples are in `ROOT/examples/tql`

=== Navigation bar

IMPORTANT: If you want your page to correctly show up in the navigation bar, edit the file `ROOT/partials/nav-main.adoc`.

== Section titles

----
== Level 1
Text.
----

----
=== Level 2
Text.
----

----
==== Level 3
Text.
----

== Links

=== Creating anchors

----
[[anchor-1]]
== Level 1

Some text with [[anchor-2]]anchor.
----

=== Creating links

----
<<anchor-1>>,
<<anchor-1,Click here>>,
----
Same as:
----
xref:anchor-2[],
xref:anchor-2[Click here].
----

External:
----
http://xy.z
http://xy.z[Click here]
----

Page links:
----
.xref:{page-version}@MODULE_NAME::PAGE_NAME.adoc[]
.xref:{page-version}@home::crash-course.adoc[]       // Example of prev line
----

== Page attributes

The above `+{page-version}+` is page attribute, which will get replaced by its assigned value (check out the `antora.yml` of the `home` module ... its value is `3.x`).

You can set page-local attribute just under the page title:
----
= Page title
:keywords: typedb, docathon
:pageTitle: HTML title
:summary: This page is about editing the docs.
:page-aliases: {page-version}@home::25-queries.adoc
----

IMPORTANT: Set page aliases to ensure the version selector finds the correct corresponding 2.x pages.

== Text formatting

----
normal, _italic_, *bold*, `code`, `formatted _code_`, `+literal _code+`
----

----
``double quoted'', `single quoted'.
----

----
normal, ^super^, ~sub~.
----

----
[big]#large#, [red]#large#, [.line-through]#wrong#, [.custom-css]#custom#
----

----
// Some comment that won't show on final page
----

== Lists

------
* Level 1 item of an unordered list
** Level 2, ... up to 5
*** Lists can be indented. Leading whitespace isn't significant.
+
----
  $ some code to execute in Level 3
----
------

To include complex content, unindent it and
put the list **continuation** sign `+` on the line
between it and the list item.

== Code blocks

.Code block with subtitle
------
[[anchor-to-block]]     // Optional (remove comment)
[,language]             // Optional (remove comment)
.Subtitle of code block // Optional (remove comment)
----
$ mkdir example
$ cd example
----
------

== Include

=== Including other .adoc files

[subs=+quotes]
----
include::**PATH/file.adoc[attributes]**
----

See below for some examples.

=== Including code into code blocks

.Include code from a different file
[,typeql,indent=0,subs=+quotes]
------
----
// Include entire file
include::**{examplesdir}/tql/typeql_file.tql[]**
// Same but versioned
include::**{page-version}@home::example$tql/typeql_file.tql[]**

// Include single region + indent
include::**{examplesdir}/tql/typeql_file.tql[tags=tagged_region,indent=8]**
// Include multiple regions
include::**{examplesdir}/tql/typeql_file.tql[tags=region1;region2]**
----
------

=== Tagging regions and TQL file structure

IMPORTANT: Store all TypeQL code files that are *_meant to be run_* in the `ROOT/examples/tql` of the module you are working on. All other example files can go into `ROOT/examples`.

.typeql_file.tql structure
----
# include::schema.tql
## ^this comment indicates that another file should be included in its entirety

# include::data.tql::tag_name
## ^this comment indicates that a tagged region from another file should be included

# pipeline::write::start
## ^this comment marks the beginning of a pipeline
match ...
delete ...
insert ...
count ...
# pipeline::write::end
## ^this comment marks the beginning of a pipeline

# pipeline::read::start
# tag::tag_name[]
match $something isa $thing;
# end::tag_name[]
# pipeline::read::end

...
----

IMPORTANT: After resolving includes, the file should be runnable end-to-end (executing one pipeline after the other).

NOTE: other files also support tagged regions of course.

== Blocks

Blocks group content.
----
--
Content

more content

in the same block

=== Tiles


To following creates two column layout of **tiles**:
----
[cols-2]
.Title
****
Some text
****

// Tiles can be links
.xref:{page-component-version}@manual::install/studio.adoc[Install]
[.clickable]
****
More text
****

// Including external links
.link:https://github.com/typedb/typedb-studio/[GitHub,window=_blank]
[.clickable]
****
More text
****
----

We also have `[cols-3]`.

=== Tabs

----
[tabs]
====
Tab1::
+
Some text

Tab2::
+
--
Other text

in block
--
====
----

=== Notes, warnings, etc.

----
[NOTE]
--
Note that notes note things.
--
----

or simply:

----
NOTE: Note that notes note things
----

=== Custom format blocks

----
[.float-group]
--
image::{page-component-version}@drivers::studio/studio.png[Image title, role="right", width = 50%, window=_blank, link=self]

+
Some text in the same block.
--
----

== Images and button-like text

=== Inline image

----
Text ... image:{page-component-version}@home::studio-icons/svg/studio_projects.svg[width=24] ... more text
----

Text button style:
----
Text ... btn:[Open Project Directory] ... more text
----

Boxed button style:
----
kbd:[Ctrl+C]
----

=== Block image

See custom format blocks above.

== Tables

=== Simple table

----
.Subtitle of table  // Optional (remove comment)
[options="header"]  // Optional (remove comment)
|===
| Relational term | TypeDB term
| Row (in table without FKs) | Entity
| Row (in table with FKs) | Relation
| Value (in a data column) | Attribute
|===
----

=== Controlled width proportions

----
[cols="2,8", options="header"]
|===
| Relational term | TypeDB term
| Row (in table without FKs) | Entity
| Row (in table with FKs) | Relation
| Value (in a data column) | Attribute
|===
----

=== Center text

----
[cols="^~,^~", options="header"]
|===
| Relational term | TypeDB term
| Row (in table without FKs) | Entity
| Row (in table with FKs) | Relation
| Value (in a data column) | Attribute
|===
----

(here `~` is "auto-width", could also write `+cols="^2,^8"+` for example)
