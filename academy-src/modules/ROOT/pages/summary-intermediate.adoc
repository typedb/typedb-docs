= TypeDB Academy: Intermediate

== Summary

Congratulations on completing the Intermediate module of TypeDB Academy!

In this module, you will have learned how to:

* Compose different query patterns.
* Structure the results of queries.
* Design schemas using the PERA model.
* Create rules to infer new data.

To begin the Advanced module, start with xref:academy::11-manipulating-stateful-objects/overview.adoc[Lesson 11].

As with any technology, you will continue learning as you use TypeDB, and you can always return to this course to recap. There are also plenty of other resources available, some of which are listed below.

Good luck on your TypeDB journey!
