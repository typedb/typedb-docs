== Total ordering

Totally ordered value types permit all equality and inequality comparison operators (viz. `==`, `!=`, `<`, `\<=`, `>`, `>=`).

Comparisons between values of different value types are only allowed between if those value types are comparable. Comparable value type
groups include:

|===
|Group | Value types

|Numeric
|`integer`, ``double``^<<double-footnote,†>>^, `decimal`

|String
|`string`

|Date
|`date`

|Datetime
|`datetime`, ``datetime-tz``^<<datetime-tz-footnote,‡>>^
|===

[#double-footnote]#^†^# Only finite `double` values are allowed in TypeDB.

[#datetime-tz-footnote]#^‡^# Values of type `datetime-tz` are ordered based on the equivalent UTC datetime. The time zone does not affect
the ordering.

== Equality only

Values of type `boolean` or `duration` can only be compared for equality (i.e. using `==` / `!=`).

NOTE: It may not be obvious why two values of type `duration` may not be comparable.
`P1D` (1 day) may be 23, 24, or 25 hours, depending on when the duration is applied, due to daylight saving time.
Thus, the result of comparing it with `PT24H` (24 hours) is indeterminate.

== String comparison

`string` values allow two additional comparison operators.

WARNING: These operators are unimplemented.

`contains` allows for checking if the string on the left-hand side contains the right-hand side string as a substring.
The `contains` operator is case-insensitive.

`like` evaluates whether the string on the left-hand side of the operator matches the regular expression string on the right-hand side.
