= With stage

The `with` stage in a data pipeline allows the local declaration of functions, which can then be used as part of the pipeline.

== Syntax

[,typeql]
----
with <function-declaration>
... # continue pipeline, may call functions in patterns
----

where `<function-declaration>` is a xref:{page-version}@typeql::functions/writing.adoc#declaration[function declaration].

== Behavior

// TODO: is this true?
* The `with` stages in a data pipeline must precede any other kind of stage (together, all `with` stages are referred to as the pipeline *preamble*)
* `with` stages *must* be followed by other data pipeline stages, i.e. `with` stages by themselves do not consitute a valid data pipeline.
* Function declarations in the preamble of a data pipeline are only valid within that pipeline (declared functions may be called in `match` and `fetch` stages).

== Validation

The usual function validation applies to the function declaration in a with clause.

== Examples


1. Find users with more friends than a specific user and return their usernames
+
[,typeql]
----
with fun friend_count($user: user) -> long:
  match friendship($user, $x)
  return count;
match
  $user1 isa user, has username "<name>";
  $user2 isa user, has username $name;
  friend_count($user1) < friend_count($user2);
select $name;
----


1. Return all "`popular`" users in the database
+
[,typeql]
----
with fun friend_count($user: user) -> long:
  match friendship($user, $x)
  return count;
with fun popular_users() -> { user }:
  match
    $x isa user;
    friend_count($x) > 500;
  return { $x };
match
  let $y in popular_users();
  $y has username $pop_name;
select $pop_name;
