= Patterns

This reference covers the usage of patterns in TypeQL.

== Scopes and operations

Pattern comprise statements containing variables. Given a pattern, the *scope* of a variable is:

* the block `{ ... }` in which variable appears at top-level (i.e., not nested in further `{...}`) but it does not appear outside of the block,
* or, the entire pattern itself if the variable appears at the top-level of the pattern itself.

A key principle of valid TypeQL pattern is:

> *_Every variable must have a unique scope._*

While a statement by itself is an (elementary) patterns, *operations* allow us to construct larger and more interesting patterns from smaller ones, and they create new scopes of variables.
