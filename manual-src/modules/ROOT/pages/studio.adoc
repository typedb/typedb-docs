== Setting up

To prepare TypeDB Studio for work, you need to complete the following steps:

. <<_select_a_project_directory,Select a project directory>> to save your queries locally.
. <<_connect_to_typedb,Connect>> to a TypeDB Cloud cluster or a TypeDB Core server.
. <<_select_database,Select a database>> to work with.

[#_select_a_project_directory]
=== Select a project directory

TypeDB Studio stores queries you work with as files in a local directory, called project directory.
To select a project directory,
click on the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_projects.svg[width=24] btn:[open folder] icon in the top toolbar.

[#_connect_to_typedb]
=== Connect to TypeDB

Select TypeDB edition below, and follow the instructions:

// tag::connect_studio[]
[tabs]
====
Cloud::

. Add address and port for at least one server from your TypeDB Cloud deployment. Close the Address management window.
. Fill in the `Username` and `Password` fields with valid user credentials.
. Turn on the `Enable TLS` option and leave the `CA Certificate` field empty. +
_For self-hosted deployments, encryption parameters may vary._
. Click `Connect`.
// end::connect_cloud_studio[]

// tag::first_login_studio[]
[NOTE]
=====
On your first login you will be asked to change the password for the `admin` account.
A TypeDB Cloud deployment will refuse queries until the password is changed from its default value.
=====
// end::first_login_studio[]

image::home::studio-connect-core.png[TypeDB Studio connect window, role=right, width = 50%, link=self]

// tag::connect_core_studio[]
. Click btn:[Connect to TypeDB] on the right side of the top toolbar.
. Make sure the `TypeDB Core` option is selected in the `Server` field.
. Enter the address and port of the server to connect to (e.g., `localhost:1729`).
. Click btn:[Connect].
// end::connect_core_studio[]
--
====
// end::connect_studio[]

[#_select_database]
=== Select a database

TypeDB can work with one database at a time.
To select a database to work with, use the dropdown menu on the right from the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_dbs.svg[width=24] btn:[database] icon
in the top toolbar.

If there are no databases yet, see how to <<_create_a_database,create>> a new one.

If the dropdown menu is greyed out and unresponsive, then check your <<_connect_to_typedb,connection>> to TypeDB.

== Querying

To send a query from TypeDB Studio to TypeDB:

1. <<_prepare_a_query>> in a tab
2. <<_run_a_query>> from a tab
3. See the <<_results,results>> of your query in all available output formats

For more information on switching session/transaction types and controls over queries and transactions,
see the <<_transaction_control>> section.

[#_prepare_a_query]
=== Prepare a query

TypeDB has a Text editor that can edit most text files and has a built-in syntax highlighting for TypeQL.
It can also run TypeQL queries from `.tql` and `.typeql` files.
Each file can have one or more queries.

To create a new file, open a new tab in the Text editor panel.
The file will be created and saved with temporary name in a hidden folder `./typedb-studio`
inside the selected project directory.
There is an autosave feature that persists all the changes made in a file to disk.
It can be disabled in settings.
By manually image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_save.svg[width=24] btn:[saving] a temporary file you can rename
and move it from the hidden folder.

[#_run_a_query]
=== Run a query

image::drivers::studio/project-schema-committed.png[Commit the Transaction,role="right",width = 50%,link=self]

Select a session type (image:manual::icons/session-data.png[])
and a transaction type (image:manual::icons/transaction-write.png[]) in the top Toolbar.

To run a query file, open it in a tab of the Text editor panel and
click the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[Run Query] button from the top Toolbar.

For a `write` transaction type wait for a query to complete its execution
and select one of the transaction control actions:
image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit],
image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_fail.svg[width=24] btn:[Close], etc.

If a `write` transaction committed successfully -- a blue pop-up with confirmation is displayed.
If any error occurs during a transaction, it is shown as a red pop-up.

For more information on different control elements for query execution, see the <<_transaction_control>> section below.

[#_results]
=== Query results

Under the *Text editor* panel there is the *Results* panel.
The Results panel is collapsed by default if no query has been run yet.

This panel has two sets of tabs: *Run* and *Output*.
Run tabs represent separate runs of a query file.
You can pin a tab to preserve it.
Otherwise, it will be rewritten with the next run.

Output tabs represent different output formats for the results: Log and Graph.
Log tab contains textual output, similar to xref:manual::console.adoc[TypeDB Console], as well as input log,
and error messages.
Graph tab is available for Get queries only.
It uses Studio's Graph Visualizer to build a graphical representation of query results.

[#_transaction_control]
=== Transaction controls

To control query execution, we have the top *Toolbar* elements located to the right from the database selection
drop-down menu.

[#_inference]
== Inference

//#todo Add a link explaining what an inference is
[#_inference_results]
image::drivers::studio/inference.png[Inference results example, role=right, width = 50%, link=self]

To run a query with inference, enable the btn:[infer] button before executing a query.
If the button is unavailable, double-check <<_connect_to_typedb,TypeDB connection>>,
<<_select_database,database selection>>,
and transaction type being set to `read`.

As a result of running a query with inference, you can get additional results via inference.
If there are any inferred instances of data returned from a Get query,
they will be highlighted with green color in the Graph Visualizer.
See an example on the image to the right.

[#_explanation]
=== Explanation

[#_explanation_results]
image::drivers::studio/explanation.png[Explanation example, role=right, width = 50%, link=self]

To run a query with explanation, turn the btn:[explain] button *on* before executing a query.
To be able to do that, the btn:[infer] and btn:[snapshot] buttons must be enabled.

If the btn:[explain] button is inactive, double-check that Studio is connected to TypeDB,
a database is selected with a drop-down list in the toolbar,
and the btn:[infer] and btn:[snapshot] buttons are *on*.

To see an explanation, find an inferred result in Graph Visualizer (should be highlighted in green)
on the Graph tab and double-click on the highlighted result.
If there is an explanation for the inferred result, it spawns in visualization as new concepts.
If there is no additional explanation available for the selected result,
or all explanations have already been spawned, a pop-up notification appears.

== Connection management

To connect, disconnect, or change connection settings, use the btn:[Connect to TypeDB] button in the top right corner.
While connected to TypeDB, the button changes its label to server's address.

== Databases management

[#_create_a_database]

[.float-group]
--
image::drivers::studio/databases-interface-iam-database.png[Database Manager with IAM database, role=right, width=50%, link=self]

Creating and deleting databases can be done via the Manage Database window.
// tag::db_manager[]
To open the Manage Database window, make sure TypeDB Studio is connected to TypeDB server
and click on the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_dbs.svg[width=24] btn:[database] button in the top toolbar.
// end::db_manager[]

To create a new database:

// tag::create_db_studio[]
. Enter the name for the new database
. Push btn:[Create].
// end::create_db_studio[]

To delete a database:

// tag::delete_db_studio[]
. Select a database to delete from a list of databases and click the trashcan icon on its right.
. Confirm deletion by typing in the name of the database to delete and then clicking the btn:[Delete] button.
// end::delete_db_studio[]
//#todo Add the icon's image
--

[#_types_browser_capabilities]
== Type Browser

image::drivers::studio/type-browser.png[Type browser, role=right framed, width=50%, link=self]

Type Browser panel gives you a full overview of the type hierarchy for the currently selected database.

In an empty database, there are only three xref:typeql::concepts/types.adoc#_type_hierarchy[root types] shown in the panel.

In a database with a schema,
all types displayed in the exact hierarchy they were created (subtypes inside their supertypes).

Double-clicking on any type opens the <<_type_editor,Type Editor>> window with information about the selected type.

=== Export schema

You can export all type definitions of a schema by clicking the btn:[Export Schema Types]
button on the top of the *Type Browser* panel.
Exporting rules is not supported by this button yet.

The button creates a new tab with inserted TypeQL Define query that creates the schema of the database.

[#_type_editor]
== Type Editor

// tag::type-editor[]
[.float-group]
--
image::drivers::studio/type-editor.png[Type editor, role=right framed, width = 50%, link=self]

Type Editor is a powerful instrument that combines easy to use GUI with API calls that can modify schema types directly,
without TypeQL queries.
With Type Editor, it's much easier to rename a type or change type hierarchy by changing a supertype of a type.
And it works even for types that already have data inserted for them.

Type Editor window gives you a full overview of the selected type: its label, parent, owned attributes, played roles,
owners (for attributes), related roles (for relations), subtypes, and whether it's an abstract type.

Type Editor can rename a type, change its supertype, change whether it's an abstract type,
add or remove owned attributes, related roles, played roles,
as well as just delete a type or export its full definition.

For the Type Editor be able to modify a schema,
make sure to switch to the `schema` session and `write` transaction in the top toolbar.
--

=== Rename a type

To rename a type:

. Open the Type Editor window by double-clicking on the selected type in the Type Browser.
. At the very top, click on the pencil icon immediately right from the type name.
. Edit the name in the Label field and press the btn:[Rename] button to save the changes.
. Commit the transaction by the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit] button at the top toolbar.
//#todo Add the pencil icon

You can also do the same by right-clicking on the type in the Type Browser panel and choosing the Rename Type option.

Renaming a type in any of these two ways updates the relevant type references in the schema and does not lead
to loosing existing data.
All existing instances of the type will be available under the new label.

=== Delete a type

To delete a type:

. Open the Type Editor window by double-clicking on the selected type in the Type Browser.
. At the very bottom, click the btn:[Delete] button and then the btn:[Confirm] button.
. Commit the transaction by the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit] button at the top toolbar.

You can also do the same by right-clicking on the type in the Type browser panel and choosing the Delete option,
then clicking the btn:[Confirm] button.

In some cases, the btn:[Delete] option and button can be unavailable.
That means there are some conditions that prevent you from deleting this type.
For example,
we can't xref:typeql::queries/undefine.adoc#_undefine_a_type_with_a_subtype[delete a type that has a subtype].
// end::type-editor[]

== Settings

To see TypeDB Studio settings, open the *Manage Preferences* window by clicking on the button with the gear (⚙) icon
in the top right corner of the window.

////
