A schema is like a blueprint of a database that contains all user-defined
xref:typeql::concepts/types.adoc[types] and rules used in a database.
All queries are validated with the TypeQL syntax and a type system of a schema.
Every piece of data inserted in a TypeDB database as an instance of a type.
Rules are used for reasoning.
