During bulk loading, data is often sourced from text files, most often in CSV or JSON format. Before it can be loaded, it must be formatted into a TypeQL query. This is best done by using scripts that build the queries from the data files. Let's consider the following JSON object, which describes a book to be loaded into a bookstore database.

[,json]
----
{
    "ISBN-13": "9780008627843",
    "ISBN-10": "0008627843",
    "Title": "The Hobbit",
    "Format": "ebook",
    "Authors": ["J.R.R. Tolkien"],
    "Editors": [],
    "Illustrators": ["J.R.R. Tolkien"],
    "Other contributors": [],
    "Publisher": "Harper Collins",
    "Page count": 310,
    "Genres": ["fiction", "fantasy"],
    "Price": 16.99
}
----

We might format it into an Insert query using the following Python function.

[,python]
----
include::attachment$bulk-loading-data-format-example.py[tag=def_build_book_query]
----

When called with the above JSON object, the function will return the following TypeQL query string.

[,typeql]
----
insert
$book isa ebook;
$book has isbn-13 "9780008627843";
$book has title "The Hobbit";
$book has page-count 310;
$book has price 16.99;
$book has isbn-10 "0008627843";
$book has genre "fiction";
$book has genre "fantasy";
$contributor_1 isa contributor;
$contributor_1 has name "J.R.R. Tolkien";
(work: $book, author: $contributor_1) isa authoring;
(work: $book, illustrator: $contributor_1) isa illustrating;
$publisher isa publisher;
$publisher has name "Harper Collins";
(published: $book, publisher: $publisher) isa publishing;
----

We have employed a few strategies to help generate the query:

* Rather than using xref:typeql::statements/overview.adoc[composite statements], we only use simple statements. This makes queries easier to construct and debug.
* Because a book might have multiple contributors, we automatically generate variable bindings for them by taking the string `"$contributor_"` and appending a number. This is a useful way of building a query that includes multiple similar variables.
* We build the query up as a list of statements and then join them into a string at the end. This helps prevent errors from occurring.
