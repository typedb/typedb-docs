= Delete query
:experimental:
:tabs-sync-option:

A Delete query is used to delete data from a TypeDB database.
A `delete` clause is executed once per every result matched by the `match` clause of the same Delete query.

This page assumes you've already followed instructions from the xref:manual::writing/insert.adoc[] page.
Here, you'll see how to delete data from a database using Studio, Console, or one of the drivers.

== How to send a Delete query

The easiest way to send a Delete query is to use Studio or Console:

[tabs]
====
Studio::
+
--
Follow the xref:manual::studio.adoc#_prepare_a_query[Studio manual]
to connect to TypeDB and select a project folder.
Then use the steps below:

. Use a drop-down list in the top toolbar to select a database.
. Switch to `data` session and `write` transaction types.
. Open a new tab and insert or type in a Delete query, for example:
+
.TypeQL Delete query
[,typeql]
----
match
$u1 isa user, has name "Bob";
$u2 isa user, has name "Charlie";
$f($u1,$u2) isa friendship;
delete
$f isa friendship;
----
. Run the query by clicking the btn:[Run query] button (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[run]).
. Commit the changes by clicking the btn:[Commit query] button (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[Commit]).
--

Console::
+
--
. Open a `data` session and `write` transaction to the selected database (e.g., `sample_db`):
+
[,bash]
----
transaction sample_db data write
----
. Send the Delete query:
+
[,bash]
----
match
$u1 isa user, has name "Bob";
$u2 isa user, has name "Charlie";
$f($u1,$u2) isa friendship;
delete
$f isa friendship;
----
+
Push btn:[Enter] twice to send the query.
. Commit the changes:
+
[,bash]
----
commit
----

== Response interpretation

A Delete query returns a Promise of an empty response.
This promise can be resolved when the query is finished executing, but it doesn't contain any useful information.

== Estimation with a read query

You can estimate what gets deletes in a Delete query
by running a preliminary Fetch or Get query with the same `match` clause in the same transaction.
Read queries can be used in a `write` transaction, and `write` transactions are snapshoted,
preventing data changes committed in other transactions from influencing the results.

You can send any type of read query,
but the most direct approach is to send an aggregated Get query to count the number of matches.
The `match` clause should be exactly the same as in the Delete query you are trying to estimate.

.Checking the number of matched results
[,typeql]
----
match
$u1 isa user, has name "Bob";
$u2 isa user, has name "Charlie";
$f($u1,$u2) isa friendship;
get; count;
----

The response is a single value of a `long` value type.
The aggregated number of matched results is equal to the number of times the `delete` clause of a Delete query
with the same `match` clause in the same `write` transaction will be executed.
Every execution of a `delete` clause tries to delete the data specified by a pattern.
If the data is deleted already by previous execution of the `delete` clause in the same query,
no additional data is deleted and no error is produced.
