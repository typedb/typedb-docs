= Update query
:experimental:
:tabs-sync-option:

An Update query is used to update data in a TypeDB database by matching existing data, deleting some of it,
and then inserting some other data instead.
A `delete` and `insert` clauses are executed once per every result
matched by the `match` clause of the same Update query.

This page assumes you've already followed instructions from the xref:manual::writing/delete.adoc[] page.
Here, you'll see how to update data in a database using Studio, Console, or one of the drivers.

== How to send an Update query

The easiest way to send an Update query is to use Studio or Console:

[tabs]
====
Studio::
+
--
Follow the xref:manual::studio.adoc#_prepare_a_query[Studio manual]
to connect to TypeDB and select a project folder.
Then use the steps below:

. Use a drop-down list in the top toolbar to select a database.
. Switch to `data` session and `write` transaction types.
. Open a new tab and insert or type in an Update query, for example:
+
.TypeQL Update query
[,typeql]
----
match
$u isa user, has name 'Charlie', has email $e;
delete
$u has $e;
insert
$u has email 'charles@vaticle.com';
----
. Run the query by clicking the btn:[Run query] button (image:home::studio-icons/run.png[run]).
. Commit the changes by clicking the btn:[Commit query] button (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[Commit]).
--

Console::
+
--
. Open a `data` session and `write` transaction to the selected database (e.g., `sample_db`):
+
[,bash]
----
transaction sample_db data write
----
. Send the Update query:
+
[,bash]
----
match
$u isa user, has name 'Charlie', has email $e;
delete
$u has $e;
insert
$u has email 'charles@vaticle.com';
----
+
Push btn:[Enter] twice to send the query.
. Commit the changes:
+
[,bash]
----
commit
----

To send an Update query programmatically, use xref:drivers::overview.adoc[drivers]:

== Response interpretation

An Update query returns all concepts that got *inserted* into the database.

Both `delete` and `insert` clauses are executed once per every result
matched by the `match` clause of the same Update query.

The `delete` clause of an Update query is executed the same number of times as the `insert` clause,
but if a concept specified for deletion is no longer present in a database for any reason,
that would not produce an error.
The query will continue its execution.

You can check the response of an Update query to see what was inserted.
The response is a Stream/Iterator with a ConceptMap object for every execution of the `insert` clause.
A ConceptMap object maps every variable from a query to a particular concept in a database.

=== Check the response

The easiest way to check the response for the query is to use a TypeDB client: Studio or Console.
For more information on how to send the above Update query,
see above the <<_how_to_send_an_update_query>> section.

Both Studio and Console should produce similar results:

[,typeql]
----
{
    $e the-bob@vaticle.com isa email;
    $u iid 0x826e80018000000000000001 isa user;
    $_0 the-bob@vaticle.com isa email;
}
----

To process the response of an Update query programmatically,
we need to collect the response and iterate through it.
See the code to check the response for the number of inserts above, in the <<_how_to_send_an_update_query>> section.

The example above checks the response of an Update query and commits the changes only if the number of
inserts is equal to the expected number (`1`).
Otherwise, it closes the transaction without committing the changes.

== Estimation with a read query

You can estimate the number of inserts in an Update query with a `match` clause
by running a dedicated Fetch or Get query with the same `match` clause in the same transaction.
Read queries can be used in a `write` transaction, and `write` transactions are snapshoted,
providing isolation from changes made by other transactions.

To estimate the number of inserts in an Update query,
use the same `write` transaction to send any type of a read query with the same `match` clause, as the Update query.
The most direct approach is to send an aggregated Get query to count the number of matches.

.Checking the number of matched results
[,typeql]
----
match
$u isa user, has name "Bob", has email $e;
get; count;
----

The response is a single number.
The aggregated number of matched results is equal to the number of times the `delete` and `insert` clauses
of a Delete query with the same `match` clause in the same `write` transaction will be executed.
