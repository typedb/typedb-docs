= Writing data

To modify any data in a TypeDB database, you need to use `data` session and `write` transaction.
All data queries are validated against the schema of a database.

Unlike schema definition queries, writing data queries are not idempotent.
Running the same query twice might result in undesirable results, like duplicating data.

There are only three types of operations that can modify data in a database:
