:summary: TypeDB server configuration guides overview.

There are two ways to configure a TypeDB server: in a xref:manual::configuring/config.adoc[config file]
or with xref:manual::configuring/arguments.adoc[command line arguments].

Command line arguments can be used with the command that starts a TypeDB server (`typedb server`)
and they have a higher priority over config file.

== Host machine requirements

The minimum host machine configuration for running a single TypeDB database is 4 (v)CPUs, 10 GB memory, with SSD.

The recommended starting configuration is 8 (v)CPUs, 16 GB memory, and SSD. Bulk loading is scaled effectively by
adding more CPU cores.

The following is the breakdown of TypeDB memory requirements:

* The JVM memory: is configurable when booting the server with `JAVAOPTS="-Xmx4g"` typedb server. This gives the JVM *4 GB*
of memory. Defaults to *25%* of system memory on most machines.
* Storage layer baseline consumption: approximately *2 GB*.
* Storage layer caches: this is about *2x* cache size per database. If the *data and index caches* sum up to *1 GB*,
the memory requirement is *2 GB* in working memory.
* Memory per CPU: approximately *0.5 GB* additional per (v)CPU under a full load.

We can estimate the amount of memory the server will need to run a single database with the following equation:

////
[stem]
++++
"required memory" = "JVM memory" + "2 GB" + (2 xx "configured db-caches in GB") + ("0.5 GB" xx "Number of CPUs")
++++
////

`required memory = JVM memory + 2 GB + (2 × configured db-caches in GB) + (0.5 GB × CPUs)`

For example, on a 4 CPU machine, with the default 1 GB of per-database storage caches, and the JVM using 4 GB of RAM,
the default requirement for memory would be: `4 GB + 2 GB + (2 × 1 GB) + (0.5 GB × 4)` = *10 GB*.

Each additional database will consume an additional amount at least equal to the cache requirements (in this example,
an additional 2 GB of memory for each database).

=== Open file limit

To support large data volumes, it is important to check the open file limit the operating system imposes. Some Unix
distributions default to `1024` open file descriptors. This can be checked with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ ulimit -n
----

We recommend this is increased to at least `50 000`.

== Diagnostics

TypeDB optionally reports anonymous diagnostics to guide the development and optimisation of TypeDB.
This data includes unexpected errors and occasional system status updates for number and size of databases,
and number of transactions executed per hour.

To disable error and diagnostic reporting set the `diagnostics.reporting.enabled` to `false` in the config file:

[,yaml]
----
diagnostics:
  reporting:
    enable: false
----
