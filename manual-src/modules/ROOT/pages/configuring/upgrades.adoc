:summary: TypeDB version upgrading.

Upgrading TypeDB installation to a newer version of TypeDB server and keeping all the data can be performed in two
different ways:

* by reusing or copying data files used for persistent storage by the server itself.
* by exporting schema and data of databases needed and then importing them to a newer installation.

The data files method usually is the fastest one, but it may not always be possible due to compatibility issues
in case there were some breaking changes in the stored data internal format. We can check what versions of TypeDB are
compatible with each other in the <<_compatibility,Compatibility>> section below.

== Copying the data files

One of the methods to migrate data from one TypeDB server version to another is by copying the data directory between
server installations.

To do this, simply shut down the servers of the old version, and copy the database to migrate from the data
directory (set by the `storage.data` parameter in the
xref:manual::configuring/config.adoc[config]) into the data directory of the new
TypeDB server installation.

Alternatively, just update the new server's xref:manual::configuring/config.adoc[configuration file] to use the same
*data directory* path as the old one.
That is why we xref:manual::configuring/config.adoc[recommend]
storing data separately from TypeDB server files.

[#_compatibility]
=== Compatibility

TypeDB will prevent us from using the same data files across incompatible database encoding versions. For more
information on TypeDB server database compatibility see the table below.

[cols="^,^"]
|===
| Database encoding version | Compatible TypeDB versions

| 0
| 2.0.0 to 2.5.0

| 1
| 2.6.0 to 2.7.1

| 2
| 2.8.0 to latest
|===

To migrate data between different database encoding versions, use the <<_export_and_import,Export and import>> features.

[#_export_and_import]
== Export and import

We can use the export/import functionality to migrate our data while switching to a newer version of TypeDB server.
Please see the xref:manual::configuring/export.adoc[] page for information on how to do that.
