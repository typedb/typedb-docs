= Config file

In this guide, you'll see how to use a config file to configure TypeDB server.

[#_configuration_file]
== File structure

TypeDB uses a config file with a specific YAML format.
See the xref:manual::configuring/config.adoc[] for examples.

TypeDB config file usually has the following top level sections:

* `server`
* `storage`
* `log`
* `diagnostics`
* `vaticle-factory`

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any change in TypeDB config file to take effect, restart the TypeDB server.
====

[#_the_default_location_of_the_config_file]
== File location

TypeDB ships with a default configuration file.
The location of this file varies based on how TypeDB has been installed.

For a manual download, find the configuration file in the `server/conf` directory inside the unzipped folder.

For Homebrew, check the following directory (replace the `+{version-number}+` placeholder with the exact
version installed):

----
/usr/local/Cellar/typedb/{version-number}/libexec/server/conf/config.yml
----

For APT, check the following directory:

----
/opt/typedb/core/server/conf/config.yml
----

//#todo Add information on the config file location for Windows and macOS (non-homebrew), Linux (non-APT)

== Cluster configuration

Every server in a TypeDB Cloud cluster has its own config file that contains a list of known servers in the cluster.
A server in a cluster will not accept connections from servers that are not on the list.

[NOTE]
====
Changes to the server configuration require a server restart to take effect.

[#_sample_configuration]
=== Config file example

Here is an example of TypeDB config file:

[,yaml]
----
server:
  address: 0.0.0.0:1729

storage:
  data: server/data
  database-cache:
    # configure storage-layer data and index cache per database
    # for large datasets, it is more important to have a large index cache than a large data cache
    data: 500mb
    index: 500mb

log:
  output:
    stdout:
      type: stdout
    file:
      type: file
      base-dir: server/logs
      file-size-limit: 50mb
      archive-grouping: month
      archive-age-limit: 1 year
      archives-size-limit: 1gb

  logger:
    default:
      level: warn
      output: [ stdout, file ]
    typedb:
      filter: com.vaticle.typedb.core
      level: info
      output: [ stdout, file ]
    storage:
      filter: com.vaticle.typedb.core.database
      level: info # on 'debug' the server will periodically log database storage properties
      output: [ stdout, file ]
  debugger:
    reasoner-tracer:
      enable: false
      type: reasoner-tracer
      output: file
    reasoner-perf-counters:
      enable: false
      type: reasoner-perf-counters

diagnostics:
  reporting:
    enable: true

vaticle-factory:
  enable: false
----

[#_server]
=== Server

The `server` section of the configuration file contains network and RPC options.

* `address`: the address to listen for TypeDB Clients connections via `gRPC`.
+
Use the `0.0.0.0` IP address to listen to all connections and `localhost` for connections from the local machine.

[#_storage_configuration]
=== Storage

The `storage` section of the configuration file contains the storage layer options.

* `data`: the location to write user data to. Defaults to within the server distribution under server/data.
* `database-cache`: *per-database* configuration for storage-level caching
** `data`: cache for often-used data.
** `index`: cache for data indexes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For production use, it is recommended that the `server.data` is set to a path outside of the `$TYPEDB_HOME`
(directory with TypeDB server files). This helps to make the process of upgrading TypeDB easier.
====

If the index cache is too small relative to the dataset, we may find severely degraded performance. We recommend
allocating at least *2%* of a database size equivalent to the index cache. For example, with *100 GB* of
on-disk data in a database, allocate at least *2 GB* of index cache. Allocating more can improve performance.

Additionally, we recommend the sum of data and index caches equal to about *20%* of the total memory of the server.

[#_log]
=== Log

See the xref:manual::configuring/logs.adoc[] page.

=== Diagnostics

TypeDB optionally reports anonymous diagnostics to guide the development and optimisation of TypeDB.
This data includes unexpected errors and occasional system status updates for number and size of databases,
and number of transactions executed per hour.

To disable error and diagnostic reporting set the `diagnostics.reporting.enabled` to `false` in the config file:

[,yaml]
----
diagnostics:
  reporting:
    enable: false
----
