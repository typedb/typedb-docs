In this guide you'll learn how to manage users in your TypeDB cloud application.

[NOTE]
====
User management features are available in TypeDB Cloud only.
====

== Management tools

You can use TypeDB Console or TypeDB driver API for managing users remotely.

Assuming TypeDB Console is xref:home::install/console.adoc[installed], to connect to TypeDB Cloud:

[source,console]
----
$ typedb console --cloud=<server-address> --username=<username> --password --tls-enabled=true
----

For more information on how to use TypeDB Console, see the xref:manual::console.adoc[] page.

For more information on user management with TypeDB driver API,
see the xref:drivers::python/api-reference.adoc#_UserManager[Python],
xref:drivers::rust/api-reference.adoc#_struct_UserManager[Rust],
xref:drivers::java/api-reference.adoc#_UserManager[Java],
xref:drivers::nodejs/api-reference.adoc#_UserManager[Node.js] API Reference pages.

[#_first_login]
== Change password on first login

The First thing you need to do is to change the default admin password:

[caption="step"]
1. Connect to a new TypeDB. +
For example, connect with TypeDB Console (see above).
Use the default credentials to do so:
+
* Username: `admin`
* Password: `password`
2. Change the password for the default `admin` user. +
For example, in TypeDB Console, use the following:
+
[,bash]
----
user password-update
----

By default, all TypeDB Cloud deployments have only one account: `admin`.
This is the administrator account with maximum privileges.
Only this account can use most of the user management features, including creating new users.

[WARNING]
====
In TypeDB Cloud, you must change the administrator's password to something different from the default value.
Until you change the password, you cannot perform *any* operations other than changing the password.
====

== Operations

The <<_current_user_password>> operation is available for any user.
All other user management operations are restricted to the built-in `admin` account only.

[#_list_all_users]

[#_current_user_password]
=== Change own password
_This action is available for any account._

To change the password of the current user, in TypeDB Console CLI run:
