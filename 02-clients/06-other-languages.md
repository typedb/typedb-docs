Community client drivers are not maintained by Vaticle; they are built and maintained fully by the community.

Don't see your language listed? Check out the [official client drivers](../03-client-api/00-overview.md), or find
out how to [create a new TypeDB client](07-new-client.md).

## Contributing

Work on TypeDB community client drivers is part of the [TypeDB Open Source Initiative](https://typedb.org).

TypeDB OSI projects are community-built. If you have an interest in contributing your work
towards any of the community clients, or any other OSI projects, join us on [Discord](https://vaticle.com/discord).
