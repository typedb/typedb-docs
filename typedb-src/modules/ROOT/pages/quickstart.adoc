== Overview

In this Quickstart guide we will learn how to do the following basic TypeDB operations with TypeDB Studio:

- Connect to a TypeDB server,
- Create a new database,
- Prepare a TypeQL file (`.tql`),
- Define a schema of a database,
- Load data into a database,
- Retrieve schema types and/or data from a database.

For this guide, we will use the sample schema and dataset designed for an
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management[Identity and Access Management,window=_blank] solution that will be
described xref:tutorials/iam-schema.adoc[later].

[IMPORTANT]
====
We highly recommend completing this guide.

Its goal is to prepare an environment for TypeDB exploration and development.
The resulting database (schema and data) will be needed for example queries throughout the documentation.

== Prerequisites

This Quickstart guide takes advantage of TypeDB Studio. It is an integrated development environment (IDE) for TypeDB.
It was specifically designed to connect to TypeDB servers (Core and Enterprise), and use TypeQL.

To proceed, please install both TypeDB and TypeDB Studio:

* xref:installation.adoc#_install[Install TypeDB]
* xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc#_download_install[Install TypeDB Studio]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use the same version numbers for TypeDB and TypeDB Studio to ensure compatibility.

If TypeDB Studio doesn't have a version similar to the TypeDB release -- use the
xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc#_version_compatibility[Version compatibility] table to determine a compatible version.
====

Alternatively, we can <<#_console_quickstart,use>> any other TypeDB Client to achieve the same results.
But we recommend trying TypeDB Studio first.

== Initialize database

=== Start TypeDB

Run the following command in a terminal:

[,bash]
----
typedb server
----

After displaying the TypeDB ASCII logo and the bootup completion time, TypeDB is ready for connections.

// ,width=640,height=480

=== Connect to TypeDB

Launch TypeDB Studio, and connect to TypeDB:

. Click the btn:[Connect to TypeDB] button (right side of the toolbar).
. Enter `localhost:1729` in the *Address* field.
. Click the btn:[Connect] button (the dialog will close after a successful connection).

=== Choose a project directory

TypeDB Studio project directory is set to allow us to organize and save related queries for future reuse.

The files and folders in the current project directory are shown in the Project panel on the left side of the window.

image::studio-project-empty.png[Project Interface empty, width = 75%, link=self]

To select a project directory:

. Click the btn:[Open Project] button in the *Project* panel (upper left).
. Choose a directory for the project files.
. Click the btn:[Open] button.

The *Project* panel will now display the contents of the selected directory and a hidden subdirectory for
unsaved files.

[#_create_a_database]
=== Create a database

. Click the database icon to open the *Manage Databases* dialog (left side of the toolbar).
+
image::studio-database.png[Database Manager button, width = 75%, link=self]

. Enter `iam` in the text field, and click the btn:[Create] button next to it.
. Click the btn:[Close] button in the bottom right.
+
image::database-manager-iam.png[Database Manager With Phone Calls Database, width = 60%, link=self]

. Select `iam` from the database dropdown (next to the database icon).

[#_prepare_a_tql_file]
=== Prepare a TypeQL file

// #todo Change the link to TypeQL -

A xref:development/schema.adoc[TypeDB schema] contains entity, relation, and attribute type definitions that make up the
data model, as well as rules which may be applied to it -- all of which are expressed in
xref:typeql::overview.adoc[TypeQL], TypeDB's query language.

To prepare the schema definition file:

. Click the `+` icon in the top left corner of the *Text editor* panel (directly right from the *Project* panel).
. Copy the `iam-schema.tql` file listing below inside the new tab.
+
[#_iam_schema]
.See the full listing of the `iam-schema.tql` file
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
include::typedb::attachment$iam-schema.tql[lines=17..]
----
====
. Click the save icon on the left side of the toolbar.
. Enter `iam-schema.tql` in the *Save As* field.
. Click the btn:[Save] button.

[NOTE]
====
Find the `iam-schema.tql` file listing expandable <<_iam_schema,above>> or download the file:
xref:typedb::attachment$iam-schema.tql[iam-schema.tql,window=_blank].
====

=== Upload the schema

To execute the TypeQL statements in the opened file and send them as queries:

. Ensure the btn:[Session type] (`schema` / `data`) switch (next to the database dropdown) is set to the `schema`.
. Ensure the btn:[Transaction type] (`write` / `read`) switch is set to the `write`.
+
image::quickstart-studio-select-transaction-type.png[Select transaction type, width = 100%, link=self]

. Click the btn:[Run Query] button (with a "play" symbol, in the middle of the toolbar) to start the transaction.
. Click the btn:[Commit Transaction] button (with a "checkmark" symbol, left of the btn:[Run Query] button) to commit
  the changes.

The transaction has been committed, and the `iam` database now has a schema.

The Types panel will now display the entity, relation, and attribute types within a type hierarchy of the IAM schema.

image::studio-type-browser-iam.png[Type browser with IAM schema, width = 75%, link=self]

Data can now be inserted.

== First important queries

=== Read the schema

TypeQL can be used to query schema types.

To execute a simple schema query:

. Ensure the btn:[Session type] (`schema` / `data`) switch is set to the `schema` (next to the database dropdown).
. Ensure the btn:[Transaction type] (`write` / `read`) switch is set to the `read`.
. Click the `+` icon right from the *Project* panel next to the `iam-schema.tql` tab in the *Text editor* panel.
. Copy the TypeQL statement below.
. Click the btn:[Run Query] button (with a "play" symbol)

[,typeql]
----
match $t sub thing;
----

The above query returns all types in the schema of the current database.
By default, the results in TypeDB Studio are visualized as a graph.

// tag::thing_deprecation[]
[WARNING]
====
The `thing` internal type will be deprecated in one of the upcoming versions and deleted in TypeDB version `3.0`.

Consider using `entity`, `attribute`, or `relation` built-in types instead.

To produce the same result as the above example, use the following query:

[,typeql]
----
match $s sub $t; {$t type entity;} or {$t type relation;} or {$t type attribute;};
----
====
// end::thing_deprecation[]

image::iam-full-schema-studio.png[IAM schema graph, width = 600, link=self]

[#_insert_data]
=== Insert data

We will insert data the same way we created the schema, by creating a `.tql` file in our project and executing it.

To create the file:

. Click the `+` icon right from the *Project* panel in the top of the *Text editor* panel, to create a new tab.
. Copy the `iam-data.tql` file listing below inside the new tab.
+
[#_iam_microdataset]
.See the full listing of the `iam-data.tql` file
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
include::typedb::attachment$iam-data.tql[lines=17..]
----
====
. Click the save icon (left side of the toolbar).
. Enter `iam-data.tql` in the *Save As* field.
. Click the btn:[Save] button.

[NOTE]
====
Find the `iam-data.tql` file listing expandable <<_iam_microdataset,above>> or download the file:
xref:typedb::attachment$iam-data.tql[iam-data.tql,window=_blank].

To insert this data to a TypeDB database we need to <<_prepare_a_tql_file,define>> the correct
<<_iam_schema,schema>> first.
====

To execute the TypeQL statements copied from the code block above:

. Ensure the btn:[Session type] (`schema` / `data`) switch (next to the database dropdown) is set to the `data`.
. Ensure the btn:[Transaction type] (`write` / `read`) switch is set to the `write`.
. Click the btn:[Run Query] button (with a "play" symbol).
. Click the btn:[Commit Transaction] button (with a "checkmark" symbol).

The transaction has been committed, and the data can now be queried.

=== Read data

To retrieve data from a database:

. Click the `+` icon right from the *Project* panel next to the `iam-data.tql` tab in the *Text editor* panel.
. Ensure the btn:[Session type] (`schema` / `data`) switch (next to the database dropdown) is set to the `data`.
. Ensure the btn:[Transaction type] (`write` / `read`) switch is set to the `read`.
. Replace the TypeQL statement in the *Text editor* panel with the one below.
. Click the btn:[Run Query] button (with a "play" symbol).

[,typeql]
----
match $f isa file, has path $fp;
----

The above query returns all `file` entities with their `path` attributes. By default, TypeDB Studio displays the
results as shown in the image below.

== Summary

The Quickstart guide above provides a fast and easy way to set up the minimum IAM database environment:
a TypeDB database with IAM schema and a small dataset. It can be used for examples in this documentation
or for independent exploration of TypeDB features.

Here are the files used in the guide above:

* xref:attachment$iam-schema.tql[iam-schema.tql,window=_blank] -- TypeQL script for the IAM schema definition.
* xref:attachment$iam-data.tql[iam-data.tql,window=_blank] -- TypeQL script to load a sample dataset into a database with the
  IAM schema.

We can do the same process of creating a database, and loading schema and data through any other
xref:clients:ROOT:clients.adoc[TypeDB Client].

Here is an example with the xref:clients:ROOT:console.adoc[TypeDB Console]:

[#_console_quickstart]
.TypeDB Console commands
[,bash]
----
# create database
typedb console --command="database create test-iam-db"

# load schema into the new database from a file
typedb console --command="transaction test-iam-db schema write" --command="source iam-schema.tql" --command="commit"

# load data into the new database from a file
typedb console --command="transaction test-iam-db data write" --command="source iam-data.tql" --command="commit"

# check the data loaded (single quotes for bash syntax compatibility with the variables like $t)
typedb console --command="transaction test-iam-db data read" --command='match $t isa thing; get $t;'
----
