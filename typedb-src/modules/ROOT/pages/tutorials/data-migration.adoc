Migrating data from other sources into TypeDB is an important step. It is considered that we have already
developed a xref:development/schema.adoc[schema] for the TypeDB database according to the data model. Accurate and
comprehensive schema design will simplify not only data migration but also the design of data queries later on.

[NOTE]
====
This tutorial is based on the **Phone calls** example in
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples[TypeDB Examples,window=_blank]
repository. Advanced users may find it faster to follow the readme files for
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples/tree/master/telecom/phone_calls/java#quickstart[Java,window=_blank],
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples/tree/master/telecom/phone_calls/python#quickstart[Python,window=_blank],
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples/tree/master/telecom/phone_calls/nodejs#quickstart[Node.js,window=_blank]
versions directly.

To load data into a TypeDB database we need to perform xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_insert[insert] queries.
The following <<_application,example>> showcases how to load <<_dataset,sample data>> from
`CSV`, `JSON`, and `XML` formats using TypeDB Drivers for
<<_java,Java>>,
<<_python,Python>>, and
<<_node_js,Node.js>>.

The same approach could be used to load data from other sources (e.g., from REST API, or other DB engines using SQL,
GraphQL) or using other xref:clients::clients.adoc[TypeDB Clients].

== Schema & data

The application described on this page is built to migrate and use the `phone_calls` database schema and dataset,
which are both provided below.

=== Schema

The schema of the `phone_calls` database is defined by the following file:

https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples/blob/master/telecom/phone_calls/schema.tql[schema.tql,window=_blank].

See the visualization below.

image::phone_calls_schema.png[phone_calls_schema]

The schema in the file above consists of the following types.

*Entity* types:

* `person`
** owns `first-name` attribute type
** owns `last-name` attribute type
** owns `phone-number` attribute type
** owns `city` attribute type
** owns `age` attribute type
** owns `started-at` attribute type
** owns `duration` attribute type
* `company`
 ** owns `name` attribute type

*Relation* types:

* `call`
** role `caller` played by `person` type
** role `callee` played by `person` type
* `contract`
 ** role `customer` played by `person` type
 ** role `provider` played by `company` type

*Attribute* types:

* `first-name` of `string` value type
* `last-name` of `string` value type
* `phone-number` of `string` value type
* `city` of `string` value type
* `age` of `long` value type
* `started-at` of `datetime` value type
* `duration` of `long` value type
* `name` of `string` value type

Use TypeDB Studio or any other TypeDB Client to xref:clients::studio.adoc#_create_a_database[create a new database]
named `phone_calls` in a TypeDB server and import the schema
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples/blob/master/telecom/phone_calls/schema.tql[file,window=_blank].

The step-by-step instructions how to create a database and load a schema file with TypeDB Studio can be found in the
xref:quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide]. Make sure to use the schema file provided above instead of the IAM schema
code/file from the Quickstart guide.

[#_dataset]
=== Dataset

Sample data for this example is available in three different formats below.

[#_csv]
[#_json]
[#_xml]
include::partial$migration-dataset.adoc[]

[#_application]
== Application

In this example we will conduct migration by building an application to read through dataset files above and insert
data into the TypeDB database created.

The Phone Calls example application showcases:

* importing <<_dataset,dataset>> into a TypeDB database from:
** CSV
** JSON
** XML
* performing TypeQL queries to the database with imported data.

==== Application logic

Data migration code is located inside `+{format}Migration.java+` file, where *\{format}* is
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples/blob/master/telecom/phone_calls/java/CSVMigration.java[CSV,window=_blank],
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples/blob/master/telecom/phone_calls/java/JSONMigration.java[JSON,window=_blank], or
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples/blob/master/telecom/phone_calls/java/XMLMigration.java[XML,window=_blank].

The `+{format}Migration+` class calls the `initialiseInputs()` method, which returns a collection of `Input` called
`inputs`. We then use each element in this collection to load each file from dataset into TypeDB database with
`+connectAndMigrate(Collection&lt;Input> inputs)+` method.

The `Input` subclass contains details required for reading data from dataset files of a chosen format:
*path to the file* and the *template* function to produce a TypeQL insert *query* out of every element of the
file. Thus, for every file, there is a separate template for forming a TypeQL insert query using the data from the
file.

The `connectAndMigrate` initializes TypeDB Java Driver, opens a session to the TypeDB database, and calls
`loadDataIntoTypeDB` for every element in `inputs`.

The `loadDataIntoTypeDB` parses the data from a file using a path from the `inputs` element, and for every item
parsed from the dataset file it calls `input.template` function (which is specific for this file, defined by its path).
Template returns a TypeQL insert query in a form of a *string*, and it then is sent as a part of a write transaction
to the TypeDB database.

==== Insert query examples

To insert an instance of a `company` type we have the following template:

[,java]
----
inputs.add(new Input("data/companies") {
      @Override
      public String template(Json company) {
        return "insert $company isa company, has name " + company.at("name") + ";";
      }
----

`input.getDataPath()` returns `data/companies`.

Given the `company` item is:

[,json]
----
{ name: "Telecom" }
----

`input.template(company)` returns:

[,typeql]
----
insert $company isa company, has name "Telecom";
----

To insert an instance of a `person` type we have the following template:

[,java]
----
inputs.add(new Input("data/people") {
    @Override
    public String template(Json person) {
        // insert person
        String typeQLInsertQuery = "insert $person isa person, has phone-number " + person.at("phone_number");
        if (! person.at("first_name").isNull()) {
            typeQLInsertQuery += ", has first-name " + person.at("first_name");
            typeQLInsertQuery += ", has last-name " + person.at("last_name");
            typeQLInsertQuery += ", has city " + person.at("city");
            typeQLInsertQuery += ", has age " + person.at("age").asInteger();
        }

        typeQLInsertQuery += ";";
        return typeQLInsertQuery;
    }
----

Given the `person` item is:

[,json]
----
{ firs-name: "Jackie", last-name: "Joe", city: "Jimo", age: 77, phone_number: "+00 091 xxx"}
----

`input.template(person)` returns:

[,typeql]
----
insert $person isa person, has phone-number "+44 091 xxx", has first-name "Jackie", has last-name "Joe", has city "Jimo", has age 77;
----

if the person item doesn't have `first-name`:

[,json]
----
{ phone_number: "+44 091 xxx" }
----

`input.template(person)` returns:

[,typeql]
----
insert $person isa person, has phone-number "+44 091 xxx";
----

But those were entities. To insert a relation we need to use `match` clause to find related instances first.

For example, to insert an instance of a `contract` type we have the following template:

[,java]
----
inputs.add(new Input("data/contracts") {
    @Override
    public String template(Json contract) {
        // match company
        String typeQLInsertQuery = "match $company isa company, has name " + contract.at("company_name") + ";";
        // match person
        typeQLInsertQuery += " $customer isa person, has phone-number " + contract.at("person_id") + ";";
        // insert contract
        typeQLInsertQuery += " insert (provider: $company, customer: $customer) isa contract;";
        return typeQLInsertQuery;
    }
----

Given the contract item is:

[,json]
----
{ company_name: "Telecom", person_id: "+00 091 xxx" }
----

`input.template(contract)` returns:

[,typeql]
----
match $company isa company, has name "Telecom"; $customer isa person, has phone-number "+00 091 xxx"; insert (provider: $company, customer: $customer) isa contract;
----

Finally, to insert an instance of a `call` type we have the following template:

[,java]
----
inputs.add(new Input("data/calls") {
    @Override
    public String template(Json call) {
        // match caller
        String typeQLInsertQuery = "match $caller isa person, has phone-number " + call.at("caller_id") + ";";
        // match callee
        typeQLInsertQuery += " $callee isa person, has phone-number " + call.at("callee_id") + ";";
        // insert call
        typeQLInsertQuery += " insert $call(caller: $caller, callee: $callee) isa call;" +
                " $call has started-at " + call.at("started_at").asString() + ";" +
                " $call has duration " + call.at("duration").asInteger() + ";";
        return typ
----

Given the call item is:

[,json]
----
{ caller_id: "+44 091 xxx", callee_id: "+00 091 xxx", started_at: 2018-08-10T07:57:51, duration: 148 }
----

`input.template(call)` returns:

[,typeql]
----
match $caller isa person, has phone-number "+44 091 xxx"; $callee isa person, has phone-number "+00 091 xxx"; insert $call(caller: $caller, callee: $callee) isa call; $call has started-at 2018-08-10T07:57:51; $call has duration 148;
----

==== Performing queries

Use the `bazel run //telecom/phone_calls/java:queries` command to perform simple queries to the database. Run it and
follow the instructions in the console.

[#_python]
=== Python

To migrate the sample dataset into the TypeDB database `phone_calls` follow the steps below. Alternatively,
clone the https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples[TypeDB repository,window=_blank] and follow the readme file
in the `telecom/phone_calls/python` directory.

==== Copy the dataset

Create a new directory on the local machine.

Choose one of the input formats, download the files, and place them in the new directory inside a subdirectory named
`data`.

include::partial$migration-dataset.adoc[]

==== Copy the source codes

Copy the following source files from the `telecom/phone_calls` directory in the
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-driver-examples[TypeDB Examples,window=_blank] repository into the new directory:

* migrate_csv.py
* migrate_json.py
* migrate_xml.py
* queries.py
* requirements.txt

==== Start migration

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required dependencies.

Use one of the following commands, depending on the chosen input format:

[tabs]
====
CSV::
+
--
[,python]
----
python migrate_csv.py
----

====

==== Application logic

Data migration code is located inside `+migrate_{format}.py+` file, where \{format} is `csv`, `json`, or `xml`.

The `build_phone_call_graph()` function initializes TypeDB Python Driver, opens a session to the TypeDB database, and
for every element of `inputs` calls `load_data_into_typedb()` function.

The `load_data_into_typedb()` function calls for `parse_data_to_dictionaries()` to parse through the dataset file and
then iterates through parsed records of the file. For every record it opens a transaction, forms an insert query by
calling the template function, then sends the insert query and commits the transaction.

The rest of the file is:

* the parsing function `parse_data_to_dictionaries()`,
* the `Inputs` list,
* and the template functions.

The parsing function parses data from a dataset file into a list of dictionaries. The implementation of the function
is different for every input format.

The `Inputs` is inserted as `inputs` argument and contains a list of dictionaries with `file` field containing
filename (without an extension) and `template` field, containing a reference to the template function to process
the file.

The template functions are the most important part, as they are needed to create TypeQL insert queries from
information parsed from dataset files.

==== Insert query examples

To insert an instance of a `company` type we have the following template:

[,python]
----
def company_template(company):
    return 'insert $company isa company, has name "' + company["name"] + '";'
----

Example:

Given the `company` item is:

[,json]
----
{ "name": "Telecom" }
----

Returns:

[,typeql]
----
insert $company isa company, has name "Telecom";
----

To insert an instance of a `person` type we have the following template:

[,python]
----
def person_template(person):
    # insert person
    typeql_insert_query = 'insert $person isa person, has phone-number "' + person["phone_number"] + '"'
    if "first_name" in person:
        # person is a customer
        typeql_insert_query += ", has is-customer true"
        typeql_insert_query += ', has first-name "' + person["first_name"] + '"'
        typeql_insert_query += ', has last-name "' + person["last_name"] + '"'
        typeql_insert_query += ', has city "' + person["city"] + '"'
        typeql_insert_query += ", has age " + str(person["age"])
    else:
        # person is not a customer
        typeql_insert_query += ", has is-customer false"
    typeql_insert_query += ";"
    return typeql_insert_query
----

Example:

Given the `person` item is:

[,json]
----
{ "phone_number": "+44 091 xxx" }
----

Returns:

[,typeql]
----
insert $person isa person, has phone-number "+44 091 xxx", has is-customer false;

    # insert contract
    typeql_insert_query += " insert (provider: $company, customer: $customer) isa contract;"
    return typeql_insert_query
----

Example:

Given the `contract` item is:

[,json]
----
{ "company_name": "Telecom", "person_id": "+00 091 xxx" }
----

Returns:

[,typeql]
----

----

To insert an instance of a `call` type we have the following template:

[,python]
----
def call_template(call):
    # match caller

    return typeql_insert_query
----

Example:

Given the `call` item is:

[,json]
----
{ "caller_id": "+44 091 xxx", "callee_id": "+00 091 xxx", "started_at": 2018-08-10T07:57:51, "duration": 148 }
----

Returns:

[,typeql]
----
match $caller isa person, has phone-number "+44 091 xxx"; $callee isa person, has phone-number "+00 091 xxx"; insert $call(caller: $caller, callee: $callee) isa call; $call has started-at 2018-08-10T07:57:51; $call has duration 148;
