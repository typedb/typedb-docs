== Introduction

*Identity and access management* (*IAM*) is a complex field that has seen massive growth over the past two decades
to meet user demand. IAM systems have become progressively more complicated to account for the variety of user
requirements and to ensure compatibility with a backlog of legacy systems. This has led to the definition of standards
by governing bodies, such as https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3[NIST,window=_blank], in an attempt to unify and simplify the
state of IAM ecosystems, as well as to establish best practices. Modern IAM systems, such as the
https://www.rsa.com/solutions/identity-governance-and-administration/[RSA's Identity Governance and Administration Platform,window=_blank],
implement these models while providing APIs to existing IAM systems an organization might have in order to unify IAM
under a single management framework.

[NOTE]
====
The terminology used in the IAM xref:quickstart-guide.adoc#_define_a_schema[schema] is defined
according to the sources mentioned above and the ISO/IEC 15408-1 standard within the context of an information system.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The IAM schema and accompanying dataset described on this page are used in the most examples throughout the
TypeDB documentation.

* xref:attachment$iam-schema.tql[iam-schema.tql,window=_blank]
* xref:attachment$iam-data.tql[iam-data.tql,window=_blank]

Check our xref:quickstart-guide.adoc[Quickstart guide] for step-by-step instructions how to load the schema and data to a
TypeDB database.
====

== Overview

As with any TypeDB schema, the IAM schema consists of:

* Types
 ** Entity types
 ** Relation types
 ** Attribute types
* Rules

[NOTE]
====
The xref:development/schema.adoc[schema] page provides more information to better understand the terminology of
TypeDB schemas.
====

As for the terminology of the IAM data model -- the main entity types in the IAM schema are:

* Subject -- Active entity in the _system_ that performs operations on objects.
 ** User -- Human or IT entity possibly interacting with the _system_ from outside of the _system_ boundary.
  *** Person -- User with `credentials`, `email`, and `full-name` attributes.
 ** User-group -- A group of users that share the same role.
* Object -- Passive entity in the _system_, that contains or receives information, and upon which subjects perform
operations.
 ** Resource -- Anything usable or consumable in the _system_.
  *** File -- File in some filesystem with `path` (to the file) and `size-kb` (file size in kB) attributes.
 ** Resource-collection -- A group of resources.
* Action -- An operation or operation set that can be performed on a specific type of object. Its name is stored in
the `name` attribute.

[NOTE]
====
In the list above some entities have attributes that are mentioned in their description.
====

The main relation types in the IAM schema:

* `permission` -- A relation that relates a subject to a specific access.
* `access` -- A relation that relates an object to a valid action performed on it.

The types mentioned above combined in a schema will look like this:

image::iam-simplified-schema.png[IAM core schema, width=60%, link=self]

The illustration above is not the full IAM schema but only the most important part of it. The least important parts
have been omitted from the image to reduce the complexity of the schema. For a full version, please see the image in
the <<_full_schema,Full schema>> section below.

== Permission and Access relations

One of the core elements of the IAM schema is the relations between `subject` and `object` entity types that allow
us to set `permissions` to access something.

There are two relation types involved: `permission` and `access`.

The `permission` relation connects a `subject` (e.g., an instance of a `person` type) via a `subject` role
and a  relation of the `access` type via an `access` role.

The `access` relation connects an `object` (e.g., an instance of the `file` type) via
an `object` role, `action` (e.g., an instance of `action` type with `name` attribute of `view_file`)
via the `action` role, and plays a role of `access` in a `permission` relation.

See the diagram below:

.Permission and access relations
image::iam-permission-access.png[Permission and access relations, width = 75%, link=self]

Taken together, a `subject` has permission to perform a specific action on a specific object. For example, `John Smith`
has permission to read the `README.md` file.

== Object subtypes

The `object` is a subtype of the base `entity` type with multiple subtypes of its own:

* Object
 ** Resource
  *** File
  *** Record
 ** Resource-collection
  *** Directory
  *** Database

=== File entity

The `file` type is not a direct subtype of the `object` type, but a subtype of the `resource` type, which is a subtype
of the `object` type. That also makes the `file` type a subtype of the `object` type, just not a direct subtype.

The `resource` subtype doesn't have any relations or attributes of its own, only those inherited from the `object` type.

The `file` type plays the same roles as the `object` supertype (parent in inheritance).

It has all the attributes the `object` supertype has and also two attributes of its own:

* `path` -- the path to the file on the filesystem
* `size-kb` -- the size of the file in KB

== Subject subtypes

The `subject` is a subtype of the base `entity` type with multiple subtypes of its own:

* subject
 ** user
  *** person
 ** user-group
  *** business-unit
  *** user-account
  *** user-role

=== Person entity

The `person` type is not a direct subtype of the `subject` type. It is a subtype of the `user` type, which is a direct
subtype of the `subject` type. That also makes the `person` type a subtype of the `subject` type.

But the `user` subtype doesn't have any relations or attributes of its own, only those inherited from the `subject` type.

The `person` type plays the same roles as the `subject` supertype.

It has all the attributes the subject supertype has as well as two attributes of its own:

* `full-name` -- the full name of the person. Usually includes first name and last name.
* `email` -- the e-mail address of the person.

== Action entity

The `action` is an abstract type (can't be instantiated), a subtype of the `entity` built-in type that has
two attributes:

* `name`
* `object-type`

Additionally, `action` can play a role in multiple relations:

* in a `access` relation as role `action`,
* in a `segregation-policy` relation as role `action`,
* in a `set-membership` relation as role `member`.

Finally, `action` has two subtypes, which are not abstract, so we can create instances of those subtypes:

* `operation` -- a single action that can be performed on an object
* `operation-set` -- a set of actions that can be performed on an object

Both subtypes inherit all the attribute and relation types defined in the action type.

== Membership subtypes

The `membership` is a relation type that has multiple subtypes for different kinds of relations, regarding membership
in groups:

* `membership`:
 ** `collection-membership` -- combines objects in resource-collections
 ** `group-membership` -- combines subjects in user-groups
 ** `set-membership` -- combines actions in operation-sets

== Ownership subtypes

The `ownership` is a relation type that has multiple subtypes for different kinds of relations, regarding ownership
groups:

* `ownership`:
 ** `object-ownership` -- assigns an owner of the subject type for an object
 ** `group-ownership` -- assigns an owner of the subject type for a user-group

== Segregation policy

`segregation-policy` is a relation type that adds information on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_duties[duty segregation,window=_blank] policies.

It has a `name` attribute and a single role `action`. Usually, multiple instances of this role in a single
relation mean these actions can't be performed by one person.

== Rules

There is only one rule in the IAM schema used in our documentation:

* `add-view-permission`

This simple rule illustrates basic inference.

[,typeql]
----
define

rule add-view-permission:
when {
    $modify isa action, has name "modify_file";
    $view isa action, has name "view_file";
    $ac_modify (object: $obj, action: $modify) isa access;
    $ac_view (object: $obj, action: $view) isa access;
    (subject: $subj, access: $ac_modify) isa permission;
} then {
    (subject: $subj, access: $ac_view) isa permission;
};
----

The `when` clause defines the following conditions:

. An `action` entity with name `modify_file`, assigned `$modify` variable.
. An `action` entity with name `view_file`, assigned `$view` variable.
. An `access` relation, that relates some `object` (`$obj`) to `$modify` as `action` role, assigned `$ac_modify`
variable.
. The similar relation but with `$view` instead and assigned `$ac_view` variable.
. A `permission` relation, that relates some `subject` (`$subj`) as `subject` to the `$ac_modify` as
`access`.

The `then` clause defines the data to infer:

. A new `permission` relation, that relates the subject `$subj` as `subject` to `$ac_view` as `permitted access`.

[NOTE]
====
These new `permission` relations, created by the rule, will not be persisted as they will be created inside a **read**
transaction with inference option enabled. They will influence the results of queries of the transaction (because
inference option is enabled for transaction) but not the persisted database data.
====

More information on rules can be found in the xref:fundamentals/inference.adoc#_rules[Inference] documentation page.

[#_add_view_permission_rule_explanation]
=== Add-view-permission rule explanation

In the rule above:

* for every `subject` that already has permission to `modify_file` action on any `object`:
** adds permission to `view_file` on the same `object` for the same `subject`.

In short, if someone has *modify* access to a file, then they have *view* access too.

It's easy to check this rule in action: by creating a `modify_file` access `permission` for a `subject`/`object` pair,
and then checking the `view_file` access `permission` for the same pair of `subject`/`object` with the
xref:development/infer.adoc#_how_to_use_inference[inference] option enabled.

[#_full_schema]
== Full schema

This is the TypeDB Studio visualization of the full IAM schema:

== Sample dataset

The sample dataset that we loaded in the xref:quickstart-guide.adoc#_iam_microdataset[Quickstart guide]
consists of the following:

* Subjects:
 ** 3 subjects with `full-name` and `email` attributes.
* Objects:
 ** 10 `objects` of the `file` type with `path` attribute and optional `size-kb` attribute.
* Operations:
 ** Only 2 operations with `name` attributes with values `modify_file` and `view_file`.
* Potential access types:
 ** All 10 `objects` set to have `modify_file` operation as `action`.
 ** All 10 `objects` set to have `view_file` operation as `action`.
* Permissions:
 ** Subject with `full-name` attribute `Kevin Morrison` set to have permission to `modify_file` action for all 10
objects.
 ** Subject with `full-name` attribute `Pearle Goodman` set to have some random permissions to `modify_file` or
`view_file` actions for some objects.
 ** Subject with `full-name` attribute `Masako Holley` doesn't have any permissions.
