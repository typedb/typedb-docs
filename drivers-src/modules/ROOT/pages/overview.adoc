TypeDB accepts client connections via gRPC based
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-protocol[TypeDB Driver RPC,window=_blank] protocol.

To build an application capable of connecting to TypeDB, we can use one of the
existing libraries implementing it, called TypeDB Drivers, or we can implement it ourselves as a new driver.

[#_typedb_drivers]
A TypeDB Driver is a library that implements *TypeDB Driver RPC* protocol and provides a language-specific native API.
TypeDB Drivers are available for some of the most popular programming languages:

[#_driver_api]
* xref:drivers::rust/overview.adoc[Rust] (xref:rust/api-reference.adoc[API reference])
* xref:drivers::python/overview.adoc[Python] (xref:python/api-reference.adoc[API reference])
* xref:drivers::java/overview.adoc[Java] (xref:java/api-reference.adoc[API reference])
* xref:drivers::nodejs/overview.adoc[Node.js] (xref:nodejs/api-reference.adoc[API reference])

//We also have some community projects for xref:other-languages.adoc[other languages].
//and provide support for creating a xref:new-driver.adoc[new driver].

We recommend instantiating a single TypeDB Driver per application.

== Architecture of a TypeDB Driver

TypeDB Drivers share a common architecture and capabilities.
The key components have to do with providing an API, opening and managing connections, sessions, and transactions,
as well as validating and sending queries, processing responses.

The following diagram illustrates the structure of a typical TypeDB Driver.

Simply put, the main components of any TypeDB Driver are the classes and methods to establish a connection to a TypeDB
database, execute queries, and process responses.

[NOTE]
====
As of version `2.24.x` the Java, Python,
and C drivers are re-implemented as wrappers on top of the Rust driver via an FFI interface.
