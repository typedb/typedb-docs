:summary: A simple example with an application using TypeDB C# driver.
:page-preamble-card: 1

In this tutorial, we'll build a sample application with the C# driver capable of basic interaction with TypeDB:

* Connect to a TypeDB server (Core or Cloud),
* Manage databases, sessions, and transactions,
* Send different types of queries.

Follow the steps below or see the
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-docs/tree/master/drivers-src/modules/ROOT/partials/tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[full source code,window=_blank].

== Environment setup

To run this sample application, you'll need:

. TypeDB: either a https://cloud.typedb.com/[TypeDB Cloud] deployment or a TypeDB Core server.
For TypeDB Core installation instructions, see the xref:home::install/core.adoc[] page.
. Download the https://www.nuget.org/packages/TypeDB.Driver/[TypeDB C# driver].
For the driver installation instructions, see the xref:drivers::csharp/overview.adoc[] page.

//#todo Consider adding virtualenv step-by-step guide
== Includes

To be able to use the TypeDB C# driver API in the Sample application, use the following include statements:

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=import]
----

== Default values

We store default values as constants in the source code:

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=constants]
----

where `DB_NAME` -- the name of the database to use;
`SERVER_ADDR` -- address of the TypeDB server to connect to;
`TYPEDB_EDITION` -- TypeDB Core or Cloud edition selector;
`CLOUD_USERNAME`/`CLOUD_PASSWORD` -- credentials to connect to TypeDB Cloud.

== Program structure

The main workflow of this sample application includes establishing a connection to TypeDB,
a new database setup, and querying.

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=main]
----

The entire `main()` function code is executed in the context of the <<_typedb_connection,network connection>>,
represented by the `driver` object that is returned by the function.

[#_typedb_connection]
== TypeDB connection

The `ConnectToTypeDB()` function takes `edition` and `addr` as mandatory parameters.

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=connection]
----

The `edition` is expected to be an Enum for selecting a TypeDB edition.
Depending on the TypeDB edition selected, this function initializes either a TypeDB Core or TypeDB Cloud connection.

TypeDB Cloud connection requires an object of the `TypeDBCredential` class
that is initialized with a username and password.
For our sample application, we have the default credentials for the `admin` account set in the code of the
`ConnectToTypeDB` function.

== Database setup

To set up a TypeDB database, we need to make sure that it exists and has the correct schema and data.
First, we check whether a database with the provided name already exists on the server.

If such a database doesn't exist, we <<_creating_a_database,create a new database>>,
<<_defining_a_schema,define its schema>>,
and <<_loading_initial_data,load initial data>>.

[NOTE]
====
To prevent data loss, avoid deleting an existing database without confirmation from a user.
====

If a database with the specified name already exists, we check whether we need to replace it.
To do so, we check the `dbReset` parameter, and, if it's `false`, ask for an input from a user.
If any of the two suggesting replacement of the database is acceptable,
we replace the database by deleting the existing database and then <<_creating_a_database,creating a new one>>.

As the final step of the database setup, we <<_testing_a_database,test it>>.

----

[#_creating_a_database]
=== Creating a new database

We create a new database with the specified name (`sample_app_db` by default)
and call functions to <<_defining_a_schema,define its schema>> and <<_loading_initial_data,load initial data>>.

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=create_new_db]
----

[#_replacing_a_database]
=== Replacing a database
We delete a database with the specified name (`sample_app_db` by default)
and call a function to <<_creating_a_database,create a new one>> instead:

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=replace_db]
----

[#_defining_a_schema]
=== Defining a schema

We use a xref:typeql::queries/define.adoc[Define query] to define a schema for the newly created database:

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=db-schema-setup]
----

The schema for the sample application is stored in the
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-docs/tree/master/drivers-src/modules/ROOT/partials/tutorials/iam-schema.tql[iam-schema.tql,window=_blank]
file.

.See the full schema
[%collapsible]
====
[,typeql]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/iam-schema.tql[lines=17..]
----
====

We use a session object passed as a parameter to open a transaction.
Then we send the contents of the file as a TypeQL Define query and commit the changes made by the transaction.

[#_loading_initial_data]
=== Loading initial data

With the schema defined, we can load initial data into our database with the
xref:typeql::queries/insert.adoc[Insert query]:

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=db-dataset-setup]
----

We read the
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-docs/tree/master/drivers-src/modules/ROOT/partials/tutorials/iam-data-single-query.tql[iam-data-single-query.tql,window=_blank]
file, send its contents as a single query, and then commit the changes.

include::drivers::partial$tutorials/iam-data-single-query.tql[lines=17..]
----

[#_testing_a_database]
=== Testing a database

With the <<_defining_a_schema,schema defined>> and <<_loading_initial_data,data loaded>>,
we test our database to make sure it's ready.
To test the database, we send a query to count the number of users in the database:

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=test-db]
----

== Query examples

After database setup is complete, we proceed with querying our database with different types of queries in the
`queries()` function:

[,js,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=queries]
----

The queries are as follows:

. <<_fetch,Fetch query>> -- to retrieve information in a JSON format
. <<_insert,Insert query>> -- to insert new data into the database
. <<_get,Get query>> -- to retrieve data from the database as stateful objects
. <<_get_infer,Get query with inference>> -- to retrieve data from the database as stateful objects using inference
. <<_update,Update query>> -- to replace data in the database
. <<_delete,Delete query>> -- to delete data from the database

Every query is implemented as a function that includes some output of the query response
and returns some meaningful data.

[#_fetch]
=== Fetch query

The main way to retrieve data from a TypeDB database is to use fetching to get values of attributes,
matched by a pattern.

Let's use a xref:typeql::queries/fetch.adoc[Fetch query] to fetch names and emails for all users in the database:

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=fetch]
----

We get the response as a stream of JSONs and iterate through it to print all String values from each JSON.

//#todo Add printing Names and E-mail from a JSON, add multiple names/e-mails implementation

[#_insert]
=== Insert query

Let's insert a new user with a `full-name` and `email` attributes to the database.

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=insert]
----

The Insert query returns a stream of ConceptMaps: one for every `insert` clause execution.
We iterate through the stream and print name and email for each ConceptMap returned.

Since the Insert query has no `match` clause, the `insert` clause is executed exactly once.
But the Insert query always returns a list of ConceptMap objects, where every ConceptMap represents an inserted result.

[#_get]
=== Get query

Let's retrieve all files available for a user with a `GetFilesByUser()` function.
It can be used with or without inference enabled.

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=get]
----

We call the function with the inference disabled (`false`) and expect it to return no results, as the query pattern
matches only files available for `view_file` action, and there are no such files initially in the database.

The `GetFilesByUser()` function checks
that there is only one user matched with the name provided by an input parameter.
It then executes the query to find the files, collect the results, and
iterates through them to print a value of every matched `path` attribute.

[NOTE]
====
For bigger numbers of results, it might be faster to iterate through a stream,
rather than collect and store the results first.
====

[#_get_infer]
=== Get query with inference

To get query results with inferred data, let's enable the `infer` parameter of the TypeDB transaction options.
We use the same `GetFilesByUser()` function, but set the `inference` parameter to `true` when we call it again.
The `add-view-permission` rule provides us with some inferred results this time.

[#_update]
=== Update query

Let's replace a path for one of the files with a new path.
We can do that by deleting ownership of the old path attribute from the file entity
and assigning it with ownership of the new path attribute with the xref:typeql::queries/update.adoc[Update query]:

[,csharp,indent=0]
----
include::drivers::partial$tutorials/csharp/tutorial.cs[tag=update]
----

We iterate through the response of the Update query and count the length of it to determine
the number of times the `delete` and `insert` clauses are executed.
We then commit the changes only if the number meets our expectation.

[#_delete]
=== Delete query

Finally, let's delete the same file we updated the path for.
First, we match the file in a Get (or Fetch) query to check how many files get matched to prevent unplanned deletes.
If the number (or any other relevant parameters) of matched results is as expected,
we proceed with a xref:typeql::queries/delete.adoc[Delete query] with the same match clause.

By using the same `write` transaction we employ snapshot isolation
to prevent any other transactions from changing the expected results.
If any other transaction makes a conflicting change before we commit this transaction,
then our transaction fails upon a commit.
