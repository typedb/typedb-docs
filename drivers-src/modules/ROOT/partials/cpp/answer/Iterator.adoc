class TypeDB::Iterator< NATIVE_ITER, NATIVE_T, T, HELPER >
----

A structure emulating std::iterator, used for streaming of query results from the server.

It is an ``input_iterator``, meaning it can only be consumed once. Valid operations are ``++it`` and ``*it`` 

Note that ``it++`` is deleted, and ``*it`` can only be called once per iterator position, owing to the move semantics of the returned data.

Also see ``Iterable``
