## What's covered?

In the following three sections, we tegether:

1. Define the [schema](/docs/examples/phone-calls-schema) for our `phone_calls` knowledge graph
2. Migrate csv, json or xml data to the knowledge graph using clients [Java](/docs/examples/phone-calls-migration-java), [Node.js](/docs/examples/phone-calls-migration-nodejs) and [Python](/docs/examples/phone-calls-migration-python)
3. [Query](/docs/examples/phone-calls-queries) the knowledge graph

## What's the knowledge graph we are going to work on?

The knowledge graph we be working on in these series is called `phone_calls` and contains a dataset of **people** who **call** each other. Those who make calls have a **contract** with a **company**.
