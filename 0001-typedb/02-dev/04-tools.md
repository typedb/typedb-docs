To work with TypeDB databases we can use one of the popular programming languages with a 
[TypeDB driver](../01-start/05-clients.md). Alternatively, we can use one of the standalone software tools:

1. [TypeDB Studio](05-studio.md) (GUI).
2. [TypeDB Console](06-console.md) (CLI).

Both tools are complete software products that can be used to connect to TypeDB and interact with it.

TypeDB Studio is mostly remarkable for its friendly graphical user interface, types explorer and graph visualization.
TypeDB Console is a powerful CLI tool often used to manage TypeDB server and its databases.
