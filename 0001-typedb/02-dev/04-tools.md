To work with TypeDB we recommend using one of the main tools provided:

1. TypeDB Studio (GUI).
2. TypeDB Console (CLI).

TypeDB Studio is an IDE for [TypeQL](../../11-query/00-overview.md) query language with built-in syntax highlighting, 
types explorer and graph visualizer for all query responses. It provides friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to 
design schemas and queries for TypeDB databases.

TypeDB Console is another powerful tool that can access most TypeDB functions and provides command line interface (CLI).
