To work with TypeDB databases we can use one of the [drivers](../01-start/05-clients.md) that are specific to the 
language we will be using. Alternatively, we can use one of the standalone tools:

1. [TypeDB Studio](05-studio.md) (GUI).
2. [TypeDB Console](06-console.md) (CLI).

Both tools are complete software products that can be used to connect to TypeDB and interact with it.

TypeDB Studio is mostly remarkable for it's friendly graphical user interface, types explorer and graph visualization.
TypeDB Console is a powerful CLI tool used to manage TypeDB server and its databases.
