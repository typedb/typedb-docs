:pageTitle: Insert query

An insert query adds data (e.g., entities, relations, and attributes) to a database.

== Syntax

Insert queries are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
[match <pattern>]
insert <pattern>
----

The optional `match` clause uses a pattern to find existing data needed to insert new data.

For example, to insert a new relation, we need to match every entity, attribute, and/or other relation that will
play a role in it to be able to address them in the `insert` clause.

The `insert` clause uses patterns to specify the data to be inserted and may include existing data found by
the `match` clause.

[NOTE]
====
A pattern consists of variables and constraints for concepts. For more information, see the
xref:data/basic-patterns.adoc#_patterns_overview[Pattern syntax] section.
====

The `insert` query is the only data query that can be without a `match` clause. In that case, the `insert` clause
pattern will be used once per query.

If there is a `match` clause before an `insert` clause, then the number of inserts will depend on the number of
answers matched by the `match` clause. The `insert` clause will be executed once per every matched answer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there are no matches for a `match` clause in an `insert` query, then there will be no inserts.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `insert` clause can have multiple statements in its pattern to insert in one query. But it can't insert types
(use xref:schema/define-types.adoc[define] to insert new types) and can't have the following:

- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Negation
- `is` keyword
====

=== Example insert query

[,typeql]
----
insert $p isa person, has full-name "Bob";
----

The above query inserts a `person` entity with a `full-name` attribute whose value is "Bob".

[NOTE]
====
If there is no attribute with this value, then it will be created by this query.
====

=== Example match-insert query

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has full-name "Bob";
insert
  $p has email "bob@vaticle.com";
----

The above query finds a `person` entity whose `full-name` attribute has a value of `Bob` and makes it the owner of
an `email` attribute with a value of `bob@vaticle.com`.

== Entities

Use the `insert` keyword followed by a pattern to insert an entity.

[,typeql]
----
insert $p isa person, has full-name "John Parkson", has email "john.parkson@gmail.com", has credential "qwerty1";
----

The above query inserts a `person` entity with the following attributes:

* `full-name` -- value is `John Parkson`,
* `email` -- value is `john.parkson@gmail.com`,
* `credential` -- value is `qwerty1`.

[NOTE]
====
If the above query were run multiple times, it would create multiple `person` entities owning the same
attributes. However, if the `person` entity type definition specified an `email` attribute with the `@key` keyword
(which adds a xref:schema/define-types.adoc#_key_attribute[uniqueness constraint]), the query would succeed the first
time and fail every time after that because, in this case, only one `person` entity can own any `email` attribute with
a specific value.
====

== Relations

Unlike entities and attributes, the `match` clause is required when inserting relations (i.e., a match insert)
because the roles in a relation are expected to be played by existing entities, other relations, or attributes.
Thus, the `match` clause is used to identify the players of roles in a new relation.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has path "iopvu.java";
  $op isa operation, has name "view_file";
insert
  $a (object: $f, action: $op) isa access;
----

In this example, we match our role players before inserting a relation. The number of relations depends on the number
of matched results. In our xref:typedb:ROOT:quickstart.adoc#_insert_data[IAM dataset], there is only one match.
If the `match` clause matches three results, three relations is inserted.

[NOTE]
====
We can insert a relation with some roles missing a role player, but that represents an incomplete data state (as
the existence of a relation suggests the existence of its role players), and there needs to be at least one role
player in an instance of a relation type.
====

=== Multiple role players

[NOTE]
====
In versions `1.7.0` and higher, a role in a relation can be played by multiple players in the same way an entity
can have multiple attributes of the same type.
====

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p1 isa subject, has full-name "Pearle Goodman";
  $p2 isa subject, has full-name "Masako Holley";
  $o isa object, has path "zewhb.java";
insert
  $obj-ownership (owner: $p1, owner: $p2, object: $o) isa object-ownership;
----

The above query:

. Finds a `person` entity (`$p1`) by its `full-name` attribute `Pearle Goodman`.
. Finds a `person` entity (`$p2`) by its `full-name` attribute `Masako Holley`.
. Finds an `object` entity (`$o`, `zewhb.java`).
. Inserts an `object-ownership` relation (`$obj-ownership`) which relates `$p1` (as `owner`) and `$p2` (as
  `owner`) to `$o` (as `object`).

In short, it makes `Pearle Goodman` and `Masako Holley` owners of the `zewhb.java` file.

=== Relations as role players

In addition to entities and attributes, the roles of a relation can be played by other relations.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $s isa subject, has full-name "Pearle Goodman";
  $o isa object, has path "zewhb.java";
  $a isa action, has name "modify_file";
  $ac (object: $o, action: $a) isa access;
insert
  $p (subject: $s, access: $ac) isa permission;
----

The above query:

. Finds a `subject` (`$s`) whose `full-name` attribute has a value of `Pearle Goodman`.
. Finds an `object` (`$o`)
whose `path` attribute has a value of `zewhb.java`.
. Finds an `action` (`$a`) whose name attribute has a value of `modify_file`.
. Finds an `access` relation (`$ac`) that relates the `$o` (as `access-object`) to `$a` (as `action`).
. Inserts a `permission` relation that relates `$s` (as `subject`) to the relation `$ac` (as
`access`).

In short, it creates the `permission` that lets `Pearle Goodman` to modify the `zewhb.java` file.

The relation of `access` type now plays the role of `access` in the inserted relation of the `permission` type.

[WARNING]
====
If a `match` clause returns multiple matched solutions, then an `insert` clause is executed for every one of them.

For more information, see the xref:data/basic-patterns.adoc[] page.
====

== Attributes

There are three ways to insert attributes:

* Insert an attribute on its own (e.g., independent of any entities, relations, or attributes).
* Insert an attribute owned by a new entity, relation, or attribute.
* Insert an attribute owned by an existing entity, relation, or attribute.

Use the `insert` keyword followed by a pattern to insert an attribute.

[,typeql]
----
insert $s 34 isa size-kb;
----

The above query inserts a `size-kb` attribute with a value of `34`. The variable `$s` is optional in this particular
query.

However, inserting one or more attributes with a new entity or a relation as owner is more common.

[,typeql]
----
insert $f isa file, has size-kb 34;
----

The above query inserts a new `file` entity owning a `size-kb` attribute with a value of `34`.

Use variables from the optional `match` clause in the `insert` clause to create a required context.
For example, to specify an existing owner for a new attribute:

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has path "README.md";
insert
  $f has size-kb 55;
----

In the above query, the `match` clause finds a `file` entity, or multiple entities, owning a `path` attribute with a
value of `README.md`. Then, it makes the matching entity/entities own a `size-kb` attribute with a value of `55`.

[NOTE]
====
In the last two examples, a new attribute would not be created if there was an existing `size-kb` attribute with the
specified value. Instead, the `file` entity would end up owning the existing one. If an existing one did not exist, a
new attribute would be created and owned by the `file` entity.

[#_multivalued_attributes]
=== Multivalued attributes

TypeDB supports multivalued attributes by allowing entities, relations, and attributes to own multiple attributes
of the same attribute type.

For example, if the `person` entity type can own the `email` attribute type, then an instance of the `person`
can own multiple (from zero to many) `email` attributes with different values.

==== Example 1

[,typeql]
----
match
  $p isa person, has name "John Parkson";
insert
  $p has email "john.parkson@vaticle.com", has email "admin@jp.com", has email "jp@gmail.com";
----

This query will assign ownership of three different attributes of the `email` type to the matched `person` entity
(or entities).

See the illustration from xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] below.

==== Example 2

[,typeql]
----
match
  $f isa file, has path "README.md";
insert
  $f has size-kb 55, has size-kb 65, has size-kb 70, has path "README2.md";
----

In the above query, `match` clause finds a `file` entity (or entities) owning a `path` attribute with a value of
`README.md`. Then, it inserts  ownerships of an additional `path` attribute and three additional `size-kb` attributes.
If the `file` entity/entities owned one `path` attribute and no `size-kb` attribute before the query, it would own two
`path` attributes and three `size-kb` attributes after it.

See the illustration from xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] below.
