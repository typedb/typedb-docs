:Summary: Insert data to a TypeDB database with an Insert query
:keywords: typeql, typedb, query, insert, write, create
:pageTitle: Insert query
:page-aliases: typeql::data/insert.adoc

An Insert query is used to insert new data into a database.
You can insert an instance of a type, assign <<_inserting_ownerships,ownership of an attribute>>,
or <<_adding_role_players_to_a_relation,add a new role player>> for a relation.
For a practical guide on how to send an Insert query to TypeDB,
see the xref:manual::writing/insert.adoc[] page of the TypeDB Manual.

== Syntax

// tag::syntax[]
An Insert query consists of an optional
<<_match_clause,match>> clause and an
<<_insert_clause,insert>> clause:

[,typeql]
----
[match <pattern>]
insert <insert_pattern>
----
// end::syntax[]
where `<insert_pattern>` is a pattern of valid data-specific TypeQL statements including xref:typeql::statements/isa.adoc[],
xref:typeql::statements/has.adoc[],
xref:typeql::statements/role-assignment.adoc[role assignment], and xref:typeql::statements/value-assignment.adoc[value assignment]. 

The _optional_ `match` clause `<pattern>` can be any valid match pattern: for more information, see the
xref:typeql::patterns/overview.adoc[Patterns] and xref:typeql::statements/overview.adoc[Statements] sections.

[#_behavior]
== Behavior
[#_insert_clause]
// tag::insert_clause[]
An Insert query inserts new data into a TypeDB database, as specified in its `insert` clause pattern. The data to be inserted is specified using _new variables_ (i.e., variables _not_ appearing in the optional `match` clause) or _values_.

* <<_insert_entity_example,Entities>>, <<_inserting_attributes,attributes>>,
or <<_inserting_relations,relations>> are inserted using
xref:typeql::statements/isa.adoc[isa] statements.
* Ownerships of attributes are inserted using a xref:typeql::statements/has.adoc[has] statement. Note that inserting an ownership of an attribute that doesn't yet exist in a database (with a new value), implicitly inserts such an attribute.
* Role players are usually assigned as a part of a <<_inserting_relations,relation insertion>> with a
xref:typeql::statements/role-assignment.adoc[role assignment] statement. 
// end::insert_clause[]

=== Query execution
[#_match_clause]
If a `match` clause is specified in an Insert query, then its `insert` clause is executed once per every result of the `match` clause. If there is no `match` clause in an Insert query, then the `insert` clause is executed exactly once.

For an Insert query to succeed, inserted data must not violate the schema of a database.

=== Query response

An Insert query returns a lazy Stream/Iterator of ConceptMap objects with the inserted data.

[#_inserting_data_with_no_matching]
== Insert without matching

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

To insert new data with no connection to existing database data, we can use an Insert query without a `match` clause:

.Insert example
[,typeql]
----
insert $p isa person, has full-name "Bob";
----

The above query inserts a `person` entity that owns a `full-name` attribute whose value is "Bob".

[NOTE]
====
If there is no such attribute in a database, then it will be created by this query implicitly.
====

== Insert with matching

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

To be able to insert new data that is connected to existing concepts,
use a `match` clause in an Insert query to match the existing data from a database first:

.Match insert example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name "Bob";
insert
$p has email "bob@typedb.com";
----

The above query finds a `person` entity that has the `full-name` attribute with the value of `Bob`
and makes it the owner of the `email` attribute with the value of `bob@typedb.com`.

If there is no person that matches the `match` clause pattern, then there will be no information inserted by the query.
If there are multiple instances that match the pattern, then every matched person will be assigned ownership of the
email attribute.

[#_insert_entity_example]
== Insert entities

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

To insert an entity, use a concept variable followed by an xref:typeql::statements/isa.adoc[isa]
statement with the entity's type (label or variable).
The `isa` is usually combined with statements to assign attribute ownerships or roles in relations.
You can use the same concept variable in multiple statements to insert more about the entity
or combine statements into a xref:typeql::statements/overview.adoc#_composite_statements[composite statement].

[NOTE]
====
Entities without any additional information associated with them are almost indistinguishable from one another.
====

While it is possible to insert an entity without any attributes owned or roles played,
such an entity can't be easily found in a database or distinguished from other entities of the same type.
As a best practice, we recommend using the same query to add at least some information about the inserted entity.

You can also use the xref:typeql::statements/key.adoc[@key] or
xref:typeql::statements/unique.adoc[@unique] annotations for an attribute type ownership schema definition
to add constraints that make it much easier to uniquely address instances of this entity type.

.Inserting an entity example
[,typeql]
----
insert
$p isa person, has full-name "John Parkson";
----

The above query inserts a `person` entity with the following attributes:

* `full-name` -- value is `John Parkson`,
* `email` -- value is `john.parkson@gmail.com`,
* `credential` -- value is `qwerty1`.

[#_inserting_attributes]
== Insert attributes

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Inserting an attribute requires setting both type and value of a new attribute.
You can specify the value with a xref:typeql::values/comparators.adoc[comparator] or
xref:typeql::statements/value-assignment.adoc[] statement.

You can insert an attribute explicitly.
Use a variable followed by a value and `isa` pattern with an attribute type to insert an attribute.

.Explicit attribute insertion
[,typeql]
----
insert
$s 34 isa size-kb;
----

Attributes that are not owned by any other instances are called
xref:typeql::queries/delete.adoc#_orphaned_attributes[orphaned attributes]
and aren't very useful to store in a database.

To implicitly insert an attribute, assign an ownership of it with a xref:typeql::statements/has.adoc[has] statement.
If an attribute with the type and value doesn't exist in the database, it is created implicitly.

.Implicit attribute insertion
[,typeql]
----
insert
$f isa file, has path "new-file.txt";
----

The above query inserts a `file` entity and assigns it an ownership of `path` attribute
with the value of `new-file.txt`.
If there is no such attribute in a database, it is inserted implicitly as a result of assigning the ownership.

[#_inserting_ownerships]
== Insert ownerships

Attributes are immutable.
Rather than changing a value of an owned attribute,
you can delete an ownership of it
and replace with an ownership of another attribute with a different value.

To insert an ownership of an attribute, use a xref:typeql::statements/has.adoc[] statement:

.Inserting ownership
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name "John Parkson";
insert
$p has credential "qwerty1";
----

The above query matches a person that has full-name "John Parkson", that we <<_insert_entity_example,inserted>> earlier,
and assign for the person to be owner of attribute of the type `credential` and value `qwerty1`.
If the attribute doesn't exist, it is created/inserted implicitly by this query.

[#_multivalued_attributes]
=== Multivalued attributes

TypeDB supports multivalued attributes by allowing ownership of multiple attributes of the same type.

For example, if the `person` entity type can own the `email` attribute type, then an instance of the `person`
can own multiple (from zero to many) `email` attributes with different values.

.Multivalued attribute example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name "John Parkson";
insert
$p has email "john.parkson@typedb.com",
    has email "admin@jp.com",
    has email "jp@gmail.com";
----

The above query assigns ownership of three different attributes of the `email` type to the matched `person` entity
from one of the previous examples: <<_insert_entity_example>>.
As a result, the matched entity should own six attributes, four of which are of the `email` type.

    "p": {
        "attribute": [
            { "value": "John Parkson", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "full-name", "root": "attribute" } },
            { "value": "admin@jp.com", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute" } },
            { "value": "jp@gmail.com", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute" } },
            { "value": "john.parkson@gmail.com", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute" } },
            { "value": "john.parkson@typedb.com", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute" } },
            { "value": "qwerty1", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "credential", "root": "attribute" } }
        ],
        "type": { "label": "person", "root": "entity" }
    }
}

[#_inserting_relations]
== Insert relations

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Inserting a relation requires specifying at least one role player.

[NOTE]
====
From a data modeling perspective, the existence of a relation implies the existence of role players for all its roles.
Inserting a relation without a role player for a role can create an incomplete data state.
Like a `marriage` relation with only one known spouse.
====

Use a xref:typeql::statements/role-assignment.adoc[] statement with an
xref:typeql::statements/isa.adoc[isa] statement in an `insert clause` to insert a relation.

.Inserting a relation
[,typeql]
----
match
$op isa operation, has name "view_file";
insert
$f isa file, has path "new-relation.txt";
$a (object: $f, action: $op) isa access;
----

In the above example we match an operation with the `view_file` name
and insert a file with the `new-relation.txt` path to insert a relation of the `access` type
between them with roles `object` and `action` played by the file and operation respectively.

[#_adding_role_players_to_a_relation]
== Insert role players

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

To add a new role player for an existing relation,
match the relation from a database and use a xref:typeql::statements/role-assignment.adoc[] statement
with only new roleplayers.
Don't use an xref:typeql::statements/isa.adoc[] statement with relation type
as it will insert a new relation instead of adding roles to an existing one.

.Adding a role player
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has path "new-relation.txt";
$op isa operation, has name "view_file";
$a (action: $op) isa access;
insert
$a (object: $f);
----

[#_multiple_role_players]
=== Multiple role players

A role in a relation can be played more than once (by multiple role players).

.Multiple players for a role
[,typeql]
----
match
$p1 isa subject, has full-name "Pearle Goodman";
$p2 isa subject, has full-name "Masako Holley";
$o isa object, has path "zewhb.java";
insert
$obj-ownership (owner: $p1, owner: $p2, object: $o) isa object-ownership;
----

The above query:

. Finds the `person` entity (`$p1`) by its `full-name` attribute `Pearle Goodman`.
. Finds the `person` entity (`$p2`) by its `full-name` attribute `Masako Holley`.
. Finds the `object` entity (`$o`) by its `path` attribute `zewhb.java`.
. Inserts an `object-ownership` relation (`$obj-ownership`) which relates `$p1` (as `owner`) and `$p2` (as
  `owner`) to `$o` (as `object`).

In short, it makes `Pearle Goodman` and `Masako Holley` both play the same role in the same relation.

// owners of the `zewhb.java` file.

////
== Relations as role players

In addition to entities and attributes, a role of a relation can be played by another relation.

.Example of relation playing a role in another relation
[,typeql]
----
match
$s isa subject, has full-name "Pearle Goodman";
$o isa object, has path "zewhb.java";
$a isa action, has name "modify_file";
$ac (object: $o, action: $a) isa access;
insert
$p (subject: $s, access: $ac) isa permission;
----

The above query:

. Finds the `subject` (`$s`) with the `full-name` attribute with the value of `Pearle Goodman`.
. Finds the `object` (`$o`) with the `path` attribute with the value of `zewhb.java`.
. Finds the `action` (`$a`) whose name attribute has a value of `modify_file`.
. Finds the `access` relation (`$ac`) that relates the `$o` (as `object`) to `$a` (as `action`).
. Inserts a `permission` relation that relates `$s` (as `subject`) to the relation `$ac` (as
`access`).

In short, it creates the `permission` that lets `Pearle Goodman` to modify the `zewhb.java` file.

The relation of `access` type now plays the role of `access` in the inserted relation of the `permission` type.
