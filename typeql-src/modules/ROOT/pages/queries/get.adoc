:keywords: typeql, query, get, read, retrieve, concepts
:pageTitle: Get query
:page-aliases: typeql::data/get.adoc

A get query retrieves concepts from a TypeDB database that you can further process with the
xref:drivers::overview.adoc#_driver_api[driver API].

Get queries can use rule-based xref:manual::reading/infer.adoc[inference].

== Syntax

// tag::syntax[]
A Get query consists of a
<<_match_clause,match>> and a
<<_get_clause,get>> clauses,
followed by optional <<_modifiers,modifiers>>.

Get queries are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
match <pattern>
get <variable> [, <variable>];
[sort <variable> [asc|desc];]
[offset <value>;]
[limit <value>;]
[group <variable>;]
[count; | (sum|max|min|mean|median|std) <variable>;]
----

Variables mentioned in a `get` clause must be bound (set) in a `match` clause of the same query.
// end::syntax[]

[#_behavior]
== Behavior

A Get query projects concepts matched from a database to language-specific programmatic objects
that can be used via the driver API methods.

A simple Get query returns a lazy stream/iterator of ConceptMap objects.
For every matched result, ConceptMap maps every query variable, mentioned in a `get` clause,
to a concept matched from a database.
A concept can be either a type or an instance of a type.

A Get query with <<_aggregation,aggregation>>, <<_grouping,grouping>>, or both has a different type of output.
See the table in the <<_modifiers, Modifiers>> section.
//#todo Change to generic Modifiers section in TypeQL?

[#_match_clause]
== Match clause

A `match` clause is mandatory in a Get query.
You can use a declarative and composable TypeQL pattern in a `match` clause and TypeDB will find data that matches
the pattern.

For more information on patterns and statements used in a `match` clause, see the
xref:typeql::patterns/overview.adoc[Patterns] and xref:typeql::statements/overview.adoc[Statements] sections.

[#_get_clause]
== Get clause

A `get` clause is used in a Get query to select variables (concept variables and value variables)
to include in every result of the output.

This clause is executed exactly once for every result matched by the preceding `match` clause of the same query.
Unless aggregation or grouping is used, `get` clause produces a ConceptMap for every matched result,
but <<_number_of_results,deduplicates>> the results.

Following the `get` keyword are one or multiple variables, separated by commas, and a semicolon at the end.
Every variable mentioned in a `get` clause adds a respective mapping of the variable to a concept in every ConceptMap
of the output.

The `get;` clause is used to get all variables mentioned in a `match` clause pattern of a query.

=== ConceptMap

To get a ConceptMap simply iterate on a stream or iterator returned in a response to a Get query.

To retrieve a database concept from a ConceptMap, use the driver API `ConceptMap.get(variable)` method,
that takes input of variable label and returns a Concept.
Further processing of a Concept is done via methods of the driver API.
//#todo Add an example in all 4 languages (with tabs) - from sending a query to getting a value out of an attribute

[#_number_of_results]
=== Number of results

A Get query can return fewer results, than answers matched by its `match` clause.
That is due to natural deduplication of results.
See an example below.

.Example of a get clause reducing the number of results
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
----

In the above example `match` clause matches all `person` type instances that own a `name` attribute.
The `get` clause then returns those attributes.

What happens if two persons have the same name?
In TypeDB database that is stored, as two entities own the same attribute (instance of the `name` attribute type).
The `match` clause finds all pairs of a person entity and its owned attribute.
But `get` clause returns only the attributes.
Since both persons own the very same attribute,
it will be returned only once, reducing the total number of results.

For more examples of filtering matched results, see the <<_results_example_1>> and <<_results_example_2>>.

[#_modifiers]
== Modifiers

There are multiple types of modifiers that can be used in a Get query to change its output:

* <<_sort_the_results>>
* <<_offset_the_results>>
* <<_limit_the_results>>
* <<_grouping>>
* <<_aggregation>>
** <<_count>>
** <<_sum>>
** <<_maximum>>
** <<_minimum>>
** <<_mean>>
** <<_median>>
** <<_standard_deviation>>

Grouping modifier or aggregation functions can drastically change a query output, including its format.
See the table below.

[#_table_output_types]
[cols="^.^1,^.^4,^.^4"]
|===
| *#* | *Query* | *Response format*

| 1
| Get query
| Stream/Iterator of *ConceptMap*

| 2
| Get query with aggregation
| *Promise* of *Value*

| 3
| Get query with grouping
| Stream/Iterator of *ConceptMapGroup*

| 4
| Get query with grouping and aggregation
| Stream/Iterator of *ValueGroup*
|===

[#_sort_the_results]
=== Sort the results

.Sort modifier syntax
[,typeql]
----
sort <variable> [asc|desc] [,<variable> [asc|desc]];
----

Use the `sort` keyword followed by a variable to sort the results.
A second argument is optional and determines the sorting order: `asc` (ascending, by default) or `desc` (descending).

.Sort example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
sort $n;
----

This query returns sorted `full-name` attributes owned by `person` entities.

To sort by multiple variables, add additional variables with a comma separator.

[#_offset_the_results]
=== Offset the results

Use the `offset` keyword followed by the number to offset the results.
This is commonly used with the `limit` keyword to return a desired range of results for pagination.
Don't forget to <<_sort_the_results,sort>> the results to ensure more deterministic and predictable results.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
sort $n;
offset 6;
limit 10;
----

The above example sorts the `full-name` attributes of all `person` entities in ascending order,
skips the first six results, and returns up to the next ten.

[#_limit_the_results]
=== Limit the number of results

.Limit modifier syntax
[,typeql]
----
limit <value>;
----

Use the `limit` keyword followed by a positive integer to limit the number of results (answers) returned.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person;
get $p;
limit 1;
----

The above example returns only one single (and random) instance of type `person`.

We recommend using the `limit` with the <<_sort_the_results,sorting aggregation>>
to get more deterministic and predictable results.

[#_grouping]
=== Grouping

We use the `group` function, optionally followed by another aggregate function, to group the results by the
specified matched variable.

The output format is a lazy stream/iterator of ConceptMapGroup objects,
that have `owner` and `ConceptMaps` methods/fields.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$x isa person, has full-name $x-n;
$pe ($x, $y) isa permission;
$y (object: $o, action: $act) isa access;
$act has name $act-n;
$o has path $o-fp;
get $x-n, $act-n, $o-fp;
sort $o-fp;
limit 3;
group $o-fp;
----

The above example returns the `full-name` attributes of all `person` entities, the `path` attributes of the `object` entities
in any `access` relations that are part of the `permission` relation with the `person` entities, and the `name`
attribute of the `action` entity in those `access` relations. The results are then sorted by the `path` attribute in
ascending order, limited by only the first three results, and grouped by `path` variable values.

The following or similar result can be obtained by running the query above without inference on the TypeDB server with
the IAM schema and dataset from the xref:home::quickstart.adoc[Quickstart guide].

.Result example
[,typeql]
----
"LICENSE" isa path => {
    {
        $act-n "modify_file" isa name;
        $x-n "Pearle Goodman" isa full-name;
        $o-fp "LICENSE" isa path;
    }    {
        $act-n "modify_file" isa name;
        $x-n "Kevin Morrison" isa full-name;
        $o-fp "LICENSE" isa path;
    }
}
"README.md" isa path => {
    {
        $act-n "modify_file" isa name;
        $x-n "Pearle Goodman" isa full-name;
        $o-fp "README.md" isa path;
    }
}
----

There can be a difference in the `full-name` attribute returned for the `README.md` path group because
the file with path `README.md` is owned by multiple persons, and we are not sorting by the `full-name`.
To avoid that, we need to sort not only by `$o-fp`, but also by the `$x-n` variable: `sort $o-fp, $x-n;`

[#_aggregation]
=== Aggregation

Aggregation performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value.

TypeDB supports the following types of aggregation:

* <<_count>>
* <<_sum>>
* <<_maximum>>
* <<_minimum>>
* <<_mean>>
* <<_median>>
* <<_standard_deviation>>

To perform aggregation in TypeDB, we add an aggregation function at the end of a Get query.
Aggregation function uses data returned by a preceding `get` clause to perform aggregation
and return an aggregated result.

[#_count]
==== Count

Use the count keyword to get the total number of the results returned.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$o isa object, has path $fp;
get $o, $fp;
count;
----

The `count` function counts the number of query results. See the <<_number_of_results>> section.

For a more complex example, see the <<_complex_get_query_example>>.

[#_sum]
==== Sum

Use the `sum` keyword to get the sum of the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s;
sum $s;
----

[WARNING]
====
Omitting the variable `$f` in the `get` clause of the above query will result in missing all duplicated values
of `$s` from the aggregation.
For more information, see the <<_number_of_results>> section.
====

[#_maximum]
==== Maximum

Use the `max` keyword to get the maximum value among the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s;
max $s;
----

[#_minimum]
==== Minimum

Use the `min` keyword to get the minimum value among the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s;
min $s;
----

[#_mean]
==== Mean

Use the `mean` keyword to get the average value of the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s;
mean $s;
----

[#_median]
==== Median

Use the `median` keyword to get the median value among the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched variable.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s;
median $s;
----

[#_standard_deviation]
==== Standard deviation

Use the `std` keyword to get the standard deviation value among the specified `long` or `double` values of the matched
variable.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has size-kb $s;
get $f, $s;
std $s;
----

== Examples

[#_simple_example]
=== Simple Get query example

A simple Get query example:

.Simple example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name "Kevin Morrison",
    has email $e;
get $e;
----

The above query uses only two variables: `$p` and `$e`.
The `full-name` attribute is not bound to a variable in this query.

The example above matches person (`$p`) with ownership of the `full-name` attribute with a value of `Kevin Morrison` and
the `email` attribute (`$e`) with any value.
The `get` clause then filters the results to retrieve only the `email` (`$e`) attributes.

The response is a stream/iterator of ConceptMap.
Every ConceptMap bounds the variable `$e` to an attribute of the `email` type, that matches the pattern.

[#_complex_get_query_example]
=== Complex Get query example

Let's try a bit more complex pattern with some modifiers:

[,typeql]
----
match
$pe ($x, $y) isa permission;
$x isa person, has full-name $x-n;
$x-n contains "Kevin";
$y (object: $o, action: $act) isa access;
$act has name $act-n;
$o has path $o-fp;
get $x-n, $act-n, $o-fp;
sort $o-fp;
group $o-fp;
count;
----

The example above uses a `match` clause to find data that matches the following conditions:

. `permission` relation (`$pe`) of `$x` and `$y` variables.
. `$x` is `person` entity that has an attribute `$x-n` with the type `full-name`.
. The value of `$x-n` should contain the substring `Kevin`.
. The `$y` is a `access` type relation of `$o` a role of object and `$act` as action.
. `$act` has an attribute `$act-n` with the type `name`.
. `$o` has an attribute `$o-fp` with the value `path`.

The `get` clause then filters the matched answers from the `match` clause to get only the concepts for the
`$x-n`, `$act-n`, `$o-fp` variables.

The results are sorted and grouped by the `$o-fp` and aggregated with the `count` function.

The response is the number of results for every `$o-fp`: number of pairs `$x-n` and `$act-n`.

[#_results_example_1]
=== Permutations

If there are multiple variables returned in every result,
then results of a query include all permutations of answers.

To illustrate that behavior, let's
see what happens if we have *three* `person` entities
and *ten* `file` entities in a database with the IAM schema and
send the following get query:

//#todo Replace the example to exclude the disjoint match pattern
//it can be a relation like $f($x,$y) isa friendship
//or an attribute ownership, like $x has $y
.Permutations example
[,typeql]
----
match
$x isa person;
$f isa file;
get $x, $f;
----

How many results are we expecting to retrieve from a database?

[NOTE]
====
Spoiler: **13** is the wrong answer here.
====

As the example above doesn't have any <<_modifiers,modifiers>>, <<_aggregation,aggregation>>, or <<_grouping,grouping>>,
the number of results will depend on the number of matched solutions for the pattern in the `match` clause.
So the TypeDB query processor will explore all possible solutions: each consisting of one `person` entity
and one `file` entity.
There are only `3 * 10 = 30` possible combinations of `person` and `file` entities, so we will get *30* results.

[#_results_example_2]
=== Variables filtering

For the following example, consider the following database schema:

[,typeql]
----
define

name sub attribute, value string;
age sub attribute, value long;
certified-fortune-teller sub attribute, value boolean;

person sub entity,
    owns name,
    owns age,
    owns certified-fortune-teller;
----

Let's explore the following query:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has name `Bob`,
    has age 31,
    has certified-fortune-teller $cft;
get $p, $cft;
----

The above query will find every `person` entity that has ownership over the instance of the attribute type `name` with
the value of `Bob`, ownership of the `age` with the value of `31`, and the ownership of the `certified-fortune-teller`
attribute with any value.

With the `get` clause, we filter the results to get the `person` instances and the corresponding
`certified-fortune-teller` attribute (represented by the `$cft` variable in the pattern) for every matched result
in a database.

[#_explanation_of_filter]
_Why not filter for just the `$cft` variable instead?_

That can drastically alter the returned results as the returned results are deduplicated by design. See the
<<_number_of_results>> section above for more information on the number of results for a Get query.

For example, let's say we have ten people with the name `Bob` and age `31` in our database.
Five of them have `certified-fortune-teller` with the value `false`, one has it as `true`,
and the rest don't have an ownership of the attribute.

====

Those Bobs that don't have the attribute ownership won't be matched by the `match` clause at all.
So we expect to get *six* results from the original Get query:
five `person` instances owning the attribute with value `false` and one with `true`.

If we remove the `$p` variable and use `get $cft;` clause instead,
we'll get only two results in response because we will only get
`certified-fortune-teller` instances, and there are only two of those: an instance with the `true` value and another
instance of the same type with the `false` value.

The initial five instances of `person` type all have ownership over the
same attribute of the `certified-fortune-teller` attribute type
with the value `false`.

To get all the results, we add the `person` type instances to the results because those are unique.
Even if some of them might have the exact same set of owned attributes, instances of the `person` type are
different instances nonetheless.

To try the get queries in that example, we need to load the <<_results_example_2,schema>> and
the <<_answers_example2_dataset,dataset>> provided above into a TypeDB database first.
