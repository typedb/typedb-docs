= Conjunction

Conjunction is the default operation between all statements and blocks of statements in a TypeQL pattern.

== Syntax

Since conjunction is the default, there is no specific syntax to apply conjunction.
Conjunction applied implicitly for all statements by default, as opposed to
xref:typeql::patterns/negation.adoc[negation] and xref:typeql::patterns/disjunction.adoc[disjunction].
For simplicity, you can think of a semicolon as a conjunction operator.

The syntax of a conjunction block:

.Syntax
[,typeql]
----
<pattern>; [<pattern>;]
----

Where each `<pattern>` can be any valid pattern with at least one variable bound outside the disjunction.

== Behavior

Conjunction is used in all TypeQL patterns by default.
It is implicitly applied between all statements separated with a semicolon.

To match a pattern, a solution must contain concepts/values for all variables used in it,
such as when variables are substituted with these values/concepts, the pattern becomes equal to True.

Hence, all statements in a pattern must be True for the pattern itself to be True.
If any statement in a conjunction is False, then the whole pattern is False.

The ordering of statements in a conjunction is irrelevant, as every statement is equaly important for the whole pattern.

== Usage in a match clause

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Let's fetch a `path` attribute for every file that a user with full-name "Kevin Morrison" has a permission to modify.
There are multiple statements we need to combine with a conjunction for them all to be matched by every solution:

// .Conjunction example
// [,typeql]
// ----
// match
// $p isa person, has full-name $name;
// $name contains "kevin";
// $p has email $email;
// fetch
// $email;
// ----

.Conjunction example
[,typeql]
----
match
$user isa user, has full-name 'Kevin Morrison';
($user, $access) isa permission;
$obj isa object, has path $path;
$access($obj, $act) isa access;
$act isa action, has name 'modify_file';
fetch $path;
----

In the above example, all statements in a `match` clause must be True for the solution to be found.
