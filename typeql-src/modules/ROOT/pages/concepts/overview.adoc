TypeQL can be used for polymorphic queries with patterns containing
xref:typeql::concepts/concept-variables.adoc[concept variables] and
xref:typeql::values/value-variables.adoc[value variables].
A concept variable can represent any type or data instance in a database.
To limit the set of possible concepts represented by a concept variable,
add constraints with TypeQL keywords, like `sub`, `isa`, `has`, etc.

////
.See an example
[%collapsible]
====
For example, by using the `sub` keyword we can limit a concept variable to be a subtype of some type.
If both sides of `sub` are variables with no additional constraints, then the only requirement for them both to be types.

.Query example
[,typeql]
----
match
$x sub $t;
get $x;
----

The same approach can be used with the `isa` keyword,
but the variable to the left of it is considered to be a data instance instead of a type.
