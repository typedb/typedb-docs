= Types

TypeQL is a polymorphic query language that supports strong typing and uses types defined in the schema of a database
to construct queries to the database.

[#_type_hierarchy]
== Type hierarchy

Types are defined in the schema of a database, and their definitions are written in TypeQL.
Types from the schema are used to design data queries to the database and are modeled with the use of the
xref:learn::5-defining-schemas/5.1-defining-individual-types.adoc[PERA model].
Type definitions can be used in Define and Undefine queries and can't use any variables.

To create new types in a schema, subtype one of the existing types.
A subtype inherits all definitions of its supertype.

By default, a schema has three built-in root types.
Root types are abstract types and need to be subtyped to use them.

.Root types
[cols="^.^1, ^.^3, ^.^4",options="header"]
|===
| Root type label | A subtype of the root type | A data instance of a subtype

| `entity`
| Entity type
| Entity

| `relation`
| Relation type
| Relation

| `attribute`
| Attribute type
| Attribute
|===

Since data instances can be named after their respective root type,
we try to prevent ambiguity by specifying whether we mean the root type or data instance in every case
if it's not obvious from the context.

== Abstract types

Abstract types can't be used to insert data instances, but can be subtyped and queried for.

To make a type abstract, use the `abstract` keyword in its definition.

.Abstract type definition example
[,typeql]
----
define

subject sub entity, abstract;

[#_example]
== Usage in a Define query

Let's define a simple schema for users:

.Define query example
[,typeql]
----
include::home::attachment$quickstart-schema.tql[]
----

== Usage in a Fetch query

Now let's fetch all types from the database:

.Fetch query example
[,typeql]
----
match
$x sub! $y;
fetch
$x;
----

This simple pattern lets us match all types from a database:

.Output
[,json]
----
{ "x": { "label": "user", "root": "entity" } }
{ "x": { "label": "entity", "root": "entity" } }
{ "x": { "label": "attribute", "root": "attribute", "value_type": "object" } }
{ "x": { "label": "relation", "root": "relation" } }
{ "x": { "label": "person", "root": "entity" } }
{ "x": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute", "value_type": "string" } }
{ "x": { "label": "full-name", "root": "attribute", "value_type": "string" } }
{ "x": { "label": "id", "root": "attribute", "value_type": "long" } }
