:pageTitle: Undefine query

An Undefine query removes type and rule definition from a schema.

Undefine queries can be used only in a schema session and write transaction.
For more information on the limitations of a schema session, see the
xref:home::acid.adoc#_schema_integrity[Schema integrity enforcement].

For more information about basics of data modeling with TypeQL, see the
xref:typeql::fundamentals.adoc[] page.

== Behavior

A Undefine query deletes existing types and rules.

An `undefine` clause uses without variables to declare a piece of schema to delete.

Undefine queries are validated with TypeQL syntax.
A database's schema is validated after applying a given query to validate its consistency.
Undefining a type also undefines all ownerships of attribute types and all roles it could play.

A deleted type must exist in a schema and have neither subtypes nor instances of data.
If any subtypes or instances of that type exist in a database,
they need to be removed prior to removing the type or in the same query.
Undefining the same type definition or rule definition twice will result in an error
because of an attempt to remove a non-existent definition from a schema.

Undefine query returns a Promise of an empty response.

== Syntax

// tag::syntax[]
An Undefine query consists of a single `undefine` clause and always starts with the `undefine` keyword.

Undefine queries are written in TypeQL with the following syntax:

[,typeql]
----
undefine <schema statements>
----

Schema statements in an `undefine` clause use TypeQL to declare types,
type definitions, and rules that need to be removed.
// end::syntax[]

[#_undefine_clause]
== Undefine clause

An `undefine` clause is used in an Undefine query to specify types and rules to be removed from a schema.

Rules are removed by using the `rule` keyword and their label.
See <<_undefine_a_rule,example>>.

Types can be removed completely by using the `sub` keyword with a supertype.
It can be a direct supertype, or non-direct, up to a root type.

Alternatively, we can remove some parts of type definition, like an ownership of an attribute type or a role to play.

== Examples

The following examples use a database with the
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-docs/blob/master/drivers-src/modules/ROOT/partials/tutorials/iam-schema.tql[IAM schema]
for Undefine queries.

=== Undefine a type

.Undefining a type example
[,typeql]
----
undefine

validity sub attribute;
change-request sub relation;
operation-set sub entity;
user-role sub user-group;
----

The above example undefines four types from the
https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-docs/blob/master/drivers-src/modules/ROOT/partials/tutorials/iam-schema.tql[IAM schema].

Note that `operation-set` is not a direct subtype of the `entity` root type.

=== Undefine ownership

.Undefining ownership
[,typeql]
----
undefine

subject owns credential;
----

The above query removes an ability for `subject` type (and all its subtypes) to own a `credential` attribute type.

Note that the `credential` type ownership is defined for the `subject` type.
Subtypes of the `subject` type also inherit the `credential` ownership, but we can't undefine it from them
because it is not defined for them in a schema.

=== Undefine a role played

.Undefining a role played
[,typeql]
----
undefine

subject plays segregation-violation:subject;
----

The above query removes the ability for the `subject` type to play the role of `subject` in the `segregation-violation`
relation type.

=== Undefine relation's role

.Undefining role
[,typeql]
----
undefine

segregation-violation relates subject;
----

The above query removes the role of `subject` from the `segregation-violation` relation.

[#_undefine_a_rule]
=== Undefine a rule

.Undefining a rule
[,typeql]
----
undefine

rule add-view-permission;
----

[#_undefine_a_type_with_a_subtype]
=== Undefine a type with a subtype

We must first undefine all subtypes of a type, before undefining the type itself.
We can use the same query to remove both the supertype and all its subtypes from a schema.

.Undefining a type with a subtype
[,typeql]
----
undefine

object sub entity;
resource sub object;
----

The above query undefines both `object` and its subtype `resource`.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using the same query to undefine supertype and all its subtypes, make sure to use the supertype
label in the subtype undefine statements (directly right from the `sub` keyword).
Otherwise, the query might fail validation, due to one of the deleted types having subtypes.
