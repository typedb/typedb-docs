= Pagination

This page covers pagination of TypeQL query results.

== Behavior

Pagination in TypeQL queries makes it possible to return a range of results, rather than retrieving all results at once.
By <<_limit_the_results,limiting>> the query to return the first `x` results,
processing them, and then sending subsequent queries with an <<_offset_the_results,offset>>, incremented by `x`,
you can iterate through the entire result set in manageable batches.

xref:typeql::modifiers/sorting.adoc[Sorting] the results is strongly advised, but is not mandatory.
Without sorting, the ordering of results is not guaranteed and can be unpredictable.
Pagination relies on sorting to traverse the full set of results.

[#_offset_the_results]
=== Offset the results

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Use the `offset` keyword followed by the number of results to skip.

.Offset example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
sort $n;
offset 2;
----

The above example sorts the `full-name` attributes of all `person` entities in ascending order (as default),
skips the first two results, and returns the rest of results.

[#_limit_the_results]
=== Limit the number of results

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Use the `limit` keyword followed by the number of results to return.

.Limit example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
limit 2;
----

The above example has no `sort` modifier,
so it returns only two almost random names owned by entities of the `person` type.

== Usage

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Combine `offset` and `limit` to paginate the results of a query.
By knowing the limit amount, we can use offset to get the full set of results in batches.
Make sure to also use sorting, as otherwise you can't guarantee the continuity of results between queries.

.Pagination example query 1
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
sort $n;
limit 2;
----

The above query returns the first two results.

.Pagination example query 2
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has full-name $n;
get $n;
sort $n;
offset 2;
limit 2;
----

The second query returns the next two results (skips two and returns another two).

By continuing to increase the `offset` value by the `limit` value we can traverse the results.
When we receive fewer results than set by the `limit` value, it should be a signal that we got all possible results.
