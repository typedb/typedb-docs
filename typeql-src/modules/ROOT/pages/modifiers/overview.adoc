= Modifiers overview

Modifiers let us process the results of a query.
By using modifiers, you can change ordering, number of results, or even the output format.

Modifiers always go at the end of a query (after all clauses).
Sorting and pagination are quite often used together.

Aggregation can be done only with a Get query and is incompatible with other modifiers.
