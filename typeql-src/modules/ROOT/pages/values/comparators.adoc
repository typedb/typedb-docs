= Comparators

== Usage

Comparing operators or comparators can be used in a `match` clause of a TypeQL query
to compare by value two variables or a variable with a static value.
You can use both concept variables and value variables with comparators.
A concept variable must represent an attribute, since only attributes have values.

Comparators are always considered to return True.
That sets a constraint on values that can be assigned to a variable used in a statement with a comparator.

The following operators are supported for comparing values: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `+<=+`.

== Equality operator

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Use the double equal sign (`==`) to declare equality between two values.

For example, let's find all files with a `size` attribute of value equal to `100`:

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$file isa file,
    has path $filepath,
    has size-kb $size;
$size == 100;
get $filepath;
----

[NOTE]
====
Since version `2.18.0` of TypeDB, the single equals sign (`=`) was *deprecated* as a comparison operator,
as it can be used to assign a value to a value variable.
It's still possible to use it as a comparator for backward compatibility,
but we recommend using `==` for equality instead.

== Inequality operator

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Use the exclamation mark with a single equal sign (`!=`) to declare inequality between two values.

For example, to find sizes for all files, that have `filepath` attribute of any value except the `README.md`:

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$file isa file,
    has path $filepath,
    has size-kb $size;
$filepath != "README.md";
get $size;
----

== Greater than / Less than operators

include::typeql::partial$iam-database-links.adoc[]

Use the greater than sign (`>`) to declare the value/variable on the left from it as strictly greater
than the one on the right from it.
For a relaxed comparison, use the "greater than or equal" sign (`≥`).

Use the less than sign (`<`) to declare the value/variable on the left from it as strictly less
than the one on the right from it.
For a relaxed comparison, use the "less than or equal" sign (`≤`).

For example, use the following query to find all files that have an attribute of the `size` type
and value less than or equal to `50`.

.Example
[,typeql]
----
match
$file isa file,
    has path $filepath,
    has size-kb $size;
$size ≤ 100;
get $filepath;
----
