## What is the TypeDB

TypeDB is a new kind of database, utilising a special type system to help you break down complex knowledge into simple 
logical concepts. Using TypeQL, TypeDB gives you powerful abstractions over low-level and complex data patterns. 
By combining TypeQL and TypeDB, we can close the gap between the language of your knowledge domain, and what the 
database can interpret and respond to.

TypeDB guarantees data integrity and safety, while enabling data-level inferences within the database itself. This new 
paradigm gives you a higher level of expressivity to simplify your work and tackle domains that seemed impossibly 
complex before.
