# TypeDB Console

The TypeDB Console, along with the [TypeDB Clients](../03-client-api/00-overview.md) and 
[Studio](../07-studio/00-overview.md), is an interface which we can use to read from and write to 
a TypeDB knowledge graph. Console interacts directly with a given database that contains the 
TypeDB knowledge graph.
