# TypeDB overview

TypeDB is a new kind of database, utilising type systems to help you break down complex problems into meaningful 
and logical systems. Using its own query language TypeQL, it gives you powerful abstractions over low-level and 
complex data patterns. By combining TypeQL and TypeDB, we can close the gap between the language of your domain, and 
what the database can interpret and respond to.

TypeDB guarantees data integrity and safety, while enabling data-level inferences within the database itself. This new 
paradigm gives you a higher level of expressivity to simplify your work and tackle domains that seemed impossibly 
complex before.

TypeQL and TypeDB allow you build a data model out of entity, relation, and attribute types. Inheritance allows 
subtypes to be defined simply and reduce complexity, while roles and rules further enhance your schema. These 
abstractions provide a higher-level framework for you to build intuitive and understandable models.
