[#_schema]
== #{counter:query}: Schema definition

TypeDB uses the Polymorphic Entity-Relation-Attribute (or PERA) Model for its schemas and data.

Entities, relations, and attributes are all first-class citizens in a data model allowing for
expressive modeling without normalization or reification.
There are three root types: `entity`, `relation`, and `attribute`;
and they can be subtyped to create user-defined types.

Consider the following schema diagram:

//, with attributes represented as blue ellipses, entities as pink rectangles, and relations as yellow diamonds:
image::typedb-in-25-queries/era-schema.png[TypeDB Studio GUI, role=framed, width = 75%, link=self]
//#todo Optimize the image
//Squish vertically by placing relation inline with entities???

Let's see how to define the schema in TypeQL with the PERA model in mind:

[#_pera_schema]
.Schema example
[,typeql]
----
define

id sub attribute, abstract, value string;
name sub id;
username sub id;
email sub id;
path sub id;
size-kb sub attribute, value long;
updated sub attribute, value datetime;

person sub entity,
    owns name;
user sub person,
    owns email @unique,
    owns username @key,
    plays permission:subject;
file sub entity,
    owns path @key,
    owns size-kb,
    plays permission:object;

permission sub relation,
    owns updated,
    relates subject,
    relates object;
----

The above xref:typeql::queries/define.adoc[Define query] defines seven attribute
xref:typeql::concepts/types.adoc[types],
three entity types, and a relation type.

Note the `user` type, that owns `email` and `username` attribute types.

To extend the schema, see the <<_extend_schema>> section.

[#_data]
== #{counter:query}: Data insertion
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>>._

All data stored in a database must be instantiated from types defined in a schema of a database.

Let's insert two users, two files, and set permissions:

[#_sample_data1]
.Insert query example
[,typeql]
----
insert
$p isa person, has name "Charlie";
$u1 isa user,
    has name "Bob",
    has username "bob_93",
    has email "bob@vaticle.com";
$u2 isa user, has username "al-capucino";
$f1 isa file, has path "README.md";
$f2 isa file,
    has path "docs/quickstart-guide.adoc",
    has size-kb 3458761;
$p1(subject:$u1, object:$f1) isa permission, has updated 2023-10-27T12:04:36;
$p2(subject:$u2, object:$f2) isa permission;
----

The above query xref:typeql::queries/insert.adoc[inserts] one instance of the `person` type,
two `user` entities,
two `file` entities,
two relations of the `permission` type,
and some attributes owned by the entities and one of the relations.

To try matching existing data before inserting, check the <<_match_insert>> section.

[#_read]
== #{counter:query}: Data retrieval
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

Patterns for data queries are based on types defined in a schema.
To retrieve usernames of all users that have permission for the file with the path `README.md`:

.Fetch query example
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has path "README.md";
$u isa user;
($u, $f) isa permission;
fetch
$u: username;
----

The above xref:typeql::queries/fetch.adoc[Fetch] query matches the `file` entity by the `path` attribute
it has ownership of.
Then it finds all users (`$u`) that participate in a relation of a `permission` type with the file.
Finally, it fetches values of `username` type attributes owned by such users.

.Fetch query result example
[,js]
----
{
    "u": {
        "username": [ { "value": "bob_93", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "username", "root": "attribute" } } ],
        "type": { "label": "user", "root": "entity" }
    }
}
----

All queries are validated both syntactically and semantically.
Try adding to the query above a constraint of user having a `path` or file having a `username`.
The modified query will not pass validation and will result in an error instead of showing no matched results.

[#_extend_schema]
== #{counter:query}: Extending a schema
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

A schema of a TypeDB database can be extended at any time without the need to rewrite existing queries.
The easiest way to extend the schema is to add a new type, add an ownership of an attribute type, add a role, or
add an ability to play a new role with a xref:typeql::queries/define.adoc[Define] query.

Let's add a new subtype and a new role to our schema:

[#_schema_extension]
.Schema extensions example
[,typeql]
----
define

action sub entity,
    owns name,
    plays permission:permitted-action;

admin sub user;

permission relates permitted-action;
----

The above Define query extends the existing schema
by adding two new entity types and a role to an existing relation type.
//The resulted schema can be visualized as following:
//
//image::typedb-in-25-queries/extended-schema.png[TypeDB Studio GUI, role=framed, width = 75%, link=self]
//
Note that you can still run <<_data,query #2>> or <<_read,query #3>> with the extended schema.

[#_match_insert]
== #{counter:query}: Data insertion with matching
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

Now let's do a match insert by adding a new file and a relevant permission for an existing user:

.Match insert example
[,typeql]
----
match
$u isa user;
$f isa file, has path "README.md";
not { ($u, $f) isa permission; };
insert
($u, $f) isa permission;
----

The above query matches the file with path `README.md` and all users, that are not in a `permission` relation.
Then it inserts such a relation for every matched `user` and `file`.

The xref:typeql::queries/insert.adoc[Insert] query type is the only one that can be used without a `match` clause.
See <<_data,query #2>>.

== #{counter:query}: Data deletion

_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>>, <<_data,query #2>>, and  <<_match_insert,query>> <<_match_insert>>._

Deleting data requires matching the data to delete first:

.Delete permissions
[,typeql]
----
match
$u isa user, has username "al-capucino";
$p(subject:$u) isa permission;
delete
$p isa permission;
----

The above query will delete all permission relations for the user with username `al-capucino`.

[#_declarative]
== #{counter:query}: Composable patterns
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

TypeQL statements are fully declarative.
They can be combined in any order to form a query pattern.
You can think of these patterns as connecting individual statements with a logical `AND`.

Every statement is a constraint to be satisfied by the query engine.
You declare constraints for the results, and the query engine will deal with the implementation,
including planning and optimizing execution.

Variables indicate unknowns that should be used somewhere else in the pattern or retrieved by the query.
Every matched result is a solution for the `match` clause pattern:
it includes a single concept (a type or an instance of a type) for every variable.

For a xref:typeql::queries/fetch.adoc[Fetch] query we use a `match` clause
to declare a pattern for the data we are looking for and a `fetch` clause to retrieve values.

.Composable pattern example
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person;
$p has name $p-name;
$p-name == "Bob";
$p has $x;
not {$x == $p-name;};
fetch $x;
----

This query matches only the person that owns the attribute with type `name` and value `Bob`
and all their owned attributes (`$x`), excluding the name `Bob`.
Then the `fetch` clause retrieves all matched attributes (`$x`).
For the data from <<_data,query #2>> it should return username `bob_93` and email `bob@vaticle.com`.

For the `match` clause pattern we included five simple statements.
All five of them must be met for the matching.

Note that while the query uses the `person` type in its pattern, the matched entity is of the `user` type.
This is due to the fact, that we used `isa` keyword, that takes into account all subtypes of the `person` type,
including the `user` type.
Try the same query with the `isa!` keyword instead.
It is used for an exact type without its subtypes.

For more information on using subtypes, see <<_inheritance_polymorphism,query>> <<_inheritance_polymorphism>> and
<<_inheritance,query>> <<_inheritance>>.

[#_abstract]
== #{counter:query}: Abstract types
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

xref:typeql::statements/abstract.adoc[Abstract types] can't be instantiated
(no data can be inserted for the abstract type), but can be subtyped.

In schema from <<_schema,query #1>> we defined `id` as an abstract type to subtype it with many different attributes,
that have the same value type and can be called an id.

Now we can do the following query:

.Abstract type example
[,typeql]
----
match $x has id $id;
get $x, $id;
----

The above xref:typeql::queries/get.adoc[Get] query can't retrieve any instances of `id` type
because it is an abstract type.
Instead, it returns instances of all its subtypes, see the visualization below.

image::typedb-in-25-queries/abstract.png[Abstract type, role=framed, width = 75%, link=self]

We use the xref:typeql::queries/get.adoc[Get] query type, because it returns all concepts from a database as a ConceptMap,
so that TypeDB Studio can build a graph visualization of the response (see above),
while xref:typeql::queries/fetch.adoc[Fetch] returns only values in a JSON.

[#_parametric_polymorphism]
== #{counter:query}: Parametric polymorphism
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

You can use polymorphic queries, including:

* Parametric polymorphism (see below)
* <<_inheritance_polymorphism,Inheritance polymorphism>>
* <<_interface_polymorphism,Interface polymorphism>>

Parametric polymorphism lets us look for a value of an attribute regardless of its type.
Querying without constraining a type can return any type that matches a pattern.
//When we don't bound a variable to a specific type, so it can be solved as multiple different ones.

Let's try one of the most generic patterns in TypeQL:

.Parametric polymorphism query example
[,typeql]
----
match $x isa! $t;
get $x, $t;
----

The above xref:typeql::queries/get.adoc[Get] query returns pairs of `$x` and `$t` concepts,
where `$x` should be an instance of data and `$t` should be its type.
Note how the type in the `isa!` statement is variablized.
Effectively this query returns all data from a database
(as `$x`) and all corresponding types of the data (as `$t`).
The number of results should match the number of instances the database has after
<<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>.

[#_inheritance_polymorphism]
== #{counter:query}: Inheritance polymorphism
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

Inheritance polymorphism lets us query for subtypes of a type used in a query.
By using a supertype in a pattern, we can get results for the supertype itself, as well as results for all its subtypes.
//When we can solve for type and its subtypes

.Inheritance polymorphism query example
[,typeql]
----
match $x isa entity;
get $x;
----

The xref:typeql::queries/get.adoc[Get] query above matches `$x` by its type.
The type must be the `entity` type or any of its subtypes.
This query should return all entities in a database.
Since `entity` is a root type, it's an <<_abstract,abstract>> type and can't be directly instantiated.
So the query returns instances of every subtype of the `entity` type.

You can easily avoid inheritance polymorphism by using the `isa!` keyword instead.

[#_interface_polymorphism]
== #{counter:query}: Interface polymorphism
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

Interface polymorphism lets us query for any types that implement a given interface.
By implementing a given interface, we mean owning an attribute type or playing a role in a relation type.

.Interface polymorphism query example
[,typeql]
----
match $x has name $name;
get $x, $name;
----

The above query matches every instance, that has any name.
It returns pairs of owning instance (`$x`) of any type and the name attribute it owns (`$name`).
The same approach could be used with playing a role in a relationship.

[#_inheritance]
== #{counter:query}: Inheritance
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

Inheritance lets subtypes use roles and attributes,
defined for their supertype (direct or nested).

Like in the following example:

.Inherited attributes example
[,typeql]
----
match
$u isa user, has name "Bob";
fetch
$u as Bob: attribute;
----

The above query matches the user with name `Bob`.
And then fetches all attributes owned by the user.
The result should look like the following JSON:

.Inherited attributes result example
[,js]
----
{
    "Bob": {
        "attribute": [
            { "value": "bob@vaticle.com", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "email", "root": "attribute" } },
            { "value": "Bob", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "name", "root": "attribute" } },
            { "value": "bob_93", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "username", "root": "attribute" } }
        ],
        "type": { "label": "user", "root": "entity" }
    }
}
----

The `user` type inherits the ability to own the `name` attribute type from its supertype -- the `person` type.
See the schema from the <<_schema,query #1>>.

== #{counter:query}: Overriding inheritance
//_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>>._

You can override an inherited ownership or a role with a new name.
//#todo Add explanation as to why it might be needed
Override uses the keyword `as` with the new type preceding the keyword, and old (inherited) type following the keyword.
The new type should be defined in the schema as a subtype of the overriden (inherited) type.

.Schema
[,typeql]
----
define

name sub attribute, abstract, value string;
full-name sub name;
path sub attribute, value string;

person sub entity, abstract,
    owns name;
user sub person,
    owns full-name as name,
    plays permission:subject;
file sub entity,
    owns path,
    plays permission:object;

permission sub relation,
    relates subject,
    relates object;

user-permission sub permission,
    relates user as subject;
----

In the query above we override the inherited `name` attribute type with the `full-name` attribute type.
We also subtype `permission` relation type with the `user-permission`, which overrides the inherited `subject` role
with the `user` role. The `object` role is inherited without overriding in this case.

In this particular example we have to make `name` an abstract type as only abstract attribute types can be subtyped.
And only abstract types can own abstract attribute types, hence, `person` is also an abstract type in this example.

== #{counter:query}: N-ary relations
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>>, <<_data,query #2>>, and <<_extend_schema,query #4>>._
//n-ary
//nested
//variadic (1 role, many role players?)

Relations in TypeDB work elegantly and naturally, without the need for joins,
tables, foreign keys, or any other tricks needed to "just make it work".

A database schema defines relation types and their roles, as well as types that can play a role.
Creating a relation is just instantiating a relation type with the exact role players that you want.

We can create an n-ary relation with just one role, for example,
a `friendship` relation with three role players for the role `friend`.

In <<_extend_schema>> section we extended the schema by adding a third role to the `permission` relation.
Now let's add a role player for this role for a relation, that was inserted before the extension of the schema:

.Relation example
[,typeql]
----
match
$u isa user, has name "Bob";
$f isa file, has path "README.md";
$p($u, $f) isa permission;
insert
$a isa action, has name "edit";
$p(permitted-action:$a);
----

The above query adds `action` entity with name `edit` to the `permission` for the user with name `Bob`
and the file with the path `README.md`.
See the visualization of the result below.

image::typedb-in-25-queries/relation.png[Relation, role=framed, width = 75%, link=self]

== #{counter:query}: Globally unique immutable attributes
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>>, <<_data,query #2>>, and <<_data,query #4>>._

Storage space and memory consumption are optimal as data is naturally deduplicated.

Attribute type is any subtype of the `attribute` root type, including nested subtypes.
An instance of an attribute type is called attribute.

Only an attribute can have a value.
An attribute can be identified by its type and value.
Hence, there can be no other attribute of the same type with the same value.

Attribute values are immutable.
We can't change the value of an attribute, but we can delete ownership of one attribute and insert ownership of another.
For example,
a person can change its name by deleting the ownership of the old name attribute
and adding a new ownership of the attribute of type `name` with the new value.

//An attribute has a unique value among all instances of the same type.

.Insert data
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person, has name "Charlie";
insert
$p has name "Bob";
$b isa person, has name "Bob", has name "Another Bob";
$a isa action, has name "Bob";
----

The above query matches the person with name `Charlie`,
and then inserts ownership of the name `Bob` to the person.
The same query also inserts new person with name `Bob` and another name `Another Bob`.
It also creates an action with the name `Bob`.

The trick is,
there is only one attribute of the type `name` and value `Bob`
and all owners from the query above have ownership of this attribute.
As well as the original `Bob` inserted in the <<_data,query #2>>.
The resulted data should look like the image below.

image::typedb-in-25-queries/attribute.png[Relation, role=framed, width = 75%, link=self]

[#_counterquery_attribute_annotations]
== #{counter:query}: Attribute annotations
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

When defining an ownership of an attribute type, we can add one of possible annotations: `@key` or `@unique`.
These annotation constraints are limiting what can be inserted into a database.

The `@unique` annotation makes the ownership constrained by uniqueness.
Among all instances of the owner type only one can own any specific attribute of the attribute type
marked with `@unique` annotation.

The `@key` annotation makes the owned attribute a key for the owner type.
That applies the uniqueness constraint and, in addition, imposes a cardinality of exactly one --
all instances of the owner type must have exactly one (no less and no more) instance of the owned attribute.

Consider the schema from the <<_data,query #2>>.

In the schema we xref:typeql::queries/define.adoc[defined]
the `username` type to be a key for the `user` type,
and the `email` to be unique, when owned by the `user` type.

Now let's see what will happen, if we'll try to violate these annotations by using the following Insert query:

.Insert data
[,typeql]
----
insert
$u1 isa user;
$u2 isa user, has username "Bob";
$u3 isa user,
    has username "Totally-not-Bob",
    has email "bob@vaticle.com";
----

The above query fails as it violates the following annotation constraints:

* the first inserted `user` doesn't have a `username`, which violates the `@key` constraint from the schema;
* the second `user` has `username` of the value `Bob`, which happens to be non-unique,
as there is another `user` owning the same attribute in the database already;
* the third `user` has correct username, but also has non-unique email, which is forbidden by the `@unique` constraint.

As a result, we have the following error:

.Error message
----
[THW04] Invalid Thing Write: Attempted to assign a key of type 'name' onto a(n) 'user' that already has one.
----

[#_counterquery_limiting_values_with_regex]
== #{counter:query}: Limiting values with regex
//define (constraint for the value that can be inserted)

We can limit possible values that an attribute can take by using a regular expression in the type definition.

.Schema with regex example
[,typeql]
----
define

status sub attribute, value string, regex "^(STARTED|STOPPED|DELETED)$";

task sub entity,
    owns status;
----

The `status` attribute type has a value type of string, but its value is limited by a regular expression.
That regular expression permits only the following exact variants of values: `STARTED`, `STOPPED`, or `DELETED`.

If a query tries to create an instance of the `status` type with, for example, the value `Created`,
it invokes the following error:

.Error message
----
Error> [THW11] Invalid Thing Write: Attempted to put an instance of 'status' with value 'Created' that does not satisfy the regular expression '^(STARTED|STOPPED|DELETED)$'.
----

//For more information on how to use regular expressions to limit attribute values,
//see the xref:typeql::data/examples.adoc[] section.

== #{counter:query}: Matching values with regex
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

Use the `like` keyword with a regular expression to set constraints for an attribute value in a `match` clause.

.Query with regex example
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has path $p;
$p like "^docs/.*$";
fetch $p;
users: {
    match ($u,$f) isa permission;
    fetch $u: username;
};
----

The query above matches all files with a path fitting the RegEx `^docs/.*$`
(any string, starting with the `docs/` substring) and fetches their path (`$p`).

It also has `users` xref:typeql::queries/fetch.adoc#_subqueries[subquery] that fetches usernames of all users,
that have a permission to access the matched file.

.Result example
[,js]
----
{
    "p": { "value": "docs/quickstart-guide.adoc", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "path", "root": "attribute" } },
    "users": [
        {
            "u": {
                "username": [ { "value": "al-capucino", "value_type": "string", "type": { "label": "username", "root": "attribute" } } ],
                "type": { "label": "user", "root": "entity" }
            }
        }
    ]
}
----

== #{counter:query}: Arithmetic
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

Arithmetic expressions let you perform basic math operations on any value in a `match` clause.

See the list of available xref:typeql::values/arithmetic.adoc#_operations[arithmetic operations].

Let's insert a few files with different sizes, that are calculated:

.Insert files with file sizes
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file, has path "docs/quickstart-guide.adoc", has size-kb $s;
?x = ($s * 2) + 200;
?y = abs ((?x * 3) - 1);
insert
$f1 isa file, has path "config.yaml", has size-kb ?x;
$f2 isa file, has path "logs.zip", has size-kb ?y;
----

The above query inserts two files with `size-kb` values calculated based on the value of the `size-kb`
of the matched existing file.
See the resulted data visualization on the image below.

image::typedb-in-25-queries/math.png[Arithmetics, role=framed, width = 75%, link=self]

[#_rule_based_inference]
== #{counter:query}: Rule-based inference
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

TypeDB reasoning engine can perform rule-based inference when you read data.
To use inference, we need to xref:typeql::queries/define.adoc[Define] rules in the schema,
open a `read` transaction with the `infer` option xref:manual::reading/infer.adoc[enabled],
and send a xref:typeql::queries/get.adoc[Get] or xref:typeql::queries/fetch.adoc[Fetch] query.

.Schema with a rule
[,typeql]
----
define

rule every-person-is-a-dude: when {
    $p isa person;
} then {
    $p has name "Dude";
};
----

The above query adds exactly one rule:
it should add an ownership of the attribute of type `name` and value `Dude` for any person.
Effectively, all instances of `person` type or its subtypes will have name `Dude`.

== #{counter:query}: Inferring new data
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>>, <<_data,query #2>>, and <<_rule_based_inference,query>> <<_rule_based_inference>>._

Let's use the `every-person-is-a-dude` rule from the previous query <<_rule_based_inference>>:

//_Make sure to xref:typedb::development/infer.adoc#_how_to_use_inference[enable the inference]
//transaction option for the following query._

.Retrieve all names for the person
[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has name "Bob",
    has name $p-name;
get $p, $p-name;
----

The above query produces the following result with inference
xref:manual::reading/infer.adoc[enabled]:

image::typedb-in-25-queries/inference.png[Inference, role=framed, width = 75%, link=self]

The inferred data is highlighted with green color.

[#_rule_chaining]
== #{counter:query}: Rules chaining
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>> and <<_data,query #2>>._

Rules can be applied one after another in a chain.

.Schema
[,typeql]
----
define

size-mb sub attribute, value long;
size-gb sub attribute, value long;

file owns size-mb,
    owns size-gb;

rule compute-mb: when {
    $f isa file,
        has size-kb $kb;
    ?mb = round($kb / 1024);
} then {
    $f has size-mb ?mb;
};

rule compute-gb: when {
    $f isa file,
        has size-mb $mb;
    ?gb = round($mb / 1024);
} then {
    $f has size-gb ?gb;
};
----

The above schema adds two rules and necessary attributes.
The first rule uses arithmetic to set value for `size-mb` depending on the value of `size-kb`.
The second rule uses the same approach, but based on the results from first rule to compute `size-gb`.

== #{counter:query}: Inferring with chaining
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>>, <<_data,query #2>>, and <<_rule_chaining,query>> <<_rule_chaining>>._

Let's use the rules from the previous query <<_rule_chaining>>:

//_Make sure to xref:typedb::development/infer.adoc#_how_to_use_inference[enable the inference]
//transaction option for the following query._

.Retrieve the result of a rule chain
[,typeql]
----
match
$f isa file,
    has size-gb $g,
    has path $p;
get $f, $g, $p;

[#_transitivity]
== #{counter:query}: Relation transitivity
_Run this query on an empty database._

Rules can enable transitivity of relations.

Transitivity lets you expand relations when certain conditions are met.
The most general case is: given a relation from A to B,
and a relation from B to C, we can imply a relation from A to C.

Using rules for transitivity can greatly simplify your TypeQL queries.

.Schema
[,typeql]
----
define

name sub attribute, value string;

group-membership sub relation,
    relates group,
    relates member;

user sub entity,
    owns name,
    plays group-membership:member;

user-group sub entity,
    owns name,
    plays group-membership:group,
    plays group-membership:member;

rule transitive-group-membership: when {
  (group: $g1, member: $g2) isa group-membership;
  (group: $g2, member: $u) isa group-membership;
} then {
  (group: $g1, member: $u) isa group-membership;
};
----

The above schema defines `group-membership` relation with two roles: `group` and `member`.
It also defines `user` that can play a `member` role and a `user-group`, that can play both roles.
Finally, we have a rule `transitive-group-membership` that adds transitivity for the `group-membership` relation.

We can include Group A in Group B,
so that every member of Group A will become a member of Group B through the transitivity of membership, as follows:

`user` -> `Group A` -> `Group B`

Transitivity rules work for any number of steps/nested levels.

////
For example, if we insert data of group-membership according to the following:

[.text-center]
`user` -> Group A -> Group B -> Group C -> Group D -> Group E

Then the transitivity, implemented by
the `transitive-group-memmbership` rule, will make `user` into a member of all groups: from Group A to Group E.

== #{counter:query}: Inserting transitive relations
_Run this query after <<_schema,query #1>>, <<_data,query #2>>, and query <<_transitivity>>._

To try relation transitivity, insert the following sample data for the schema in the previous query:

.Insert sample data for relation transitivity
[,typeql]
----
insert
$u1 isa user, has name "Alice";
$u2 isa user, has name "Bob";
$u3 isa user, has name "Charlie";
$uga isa user-group, has name "Group A";
$ugb isa user-group, has name "Group B";
$ugc isa user-group, has name "Group C";
(group:$ugb, member:$uga) isa group-membership;
(group:$ugc, member:$ugb) isa group-membership;
(group:$uga, member:$u1) isa group-membership;
(group:$ugb, member:$u2) isa group-membership;
(group:$ugc, member:$u3) isa group-membership;
----

In the query above, we insert three users, three user groups and assign a membership in the following way:

* `Group A` is a member of `Group B`
* `Group B` is a member of `Group C`
* User `Alice` is a member of `Group A`
* User `Bob` is a member of `Group B`
* User `Charlie` is a member of `Group C`

By the  `transitive-group-memmbership` rule from the query <<_transitivity>>,
the user `Alice` should be a member of all groups: A, B, and C.

`Alice` -> `Group A` -> `Group B` -> `Group C`

Using inference, we can infer the following data from a database with the inserted data from the query above:

Notice the four inferred relations in green color.
