This Quickstart guide shows how to set up a TypeDB database and run queries using xref:manual::studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio]. The guide is available in both video and text formats.

[#_define_a_schema]
== Define a schema

A new database needs a schema before we can load any data:

. Ensure the session type toggle (image:manual::icons/session-schema.png[]) is set to `schema` and the transaction type toggle (image:manual::icons/transaction-write.png[]) is set to `write`.
. Open a image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_new.svg[width=24] btn:[New Tab] in the btn:[Text Editor] and paste in the following Define query.
+
[,typeql]
----
define
  user sub entity,
    owns id @key,
    owns name,
    owns birth-date,
    plays purchase:buyer;
  order sub entity,
    owns id @key,
    owns timestamp,
    owns status,
    plays purchase:order;

  purchase sub relation,
    relates order,
    relates buyer;

  id sub attribute, value string;
  name sub attribute, value string;
  birth-date sub attribute, value datetime;
  timestamp sub attribute, value datetime;
  status sub attribute,
    value string,
    regex "^(paid|dispatched|delivered|returned|canceled)$";
----
. Click the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[Run Query] button.
. When the query has completed, click image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit Transaction].

With the schema defined, we can now insert data into the database.

[#_load_data]
== Load data

Let's insert sample data for our newly defined schema:

. Ensure the session toggle is set to `data` and the transaction toggle is set to `write`.
. Open a new tab and paste in the following Insert query.
+
[,typeql]
----
insert
  $user-1 isa user,
    has id "u0001",
    has name "Kevin Morrison",
    has birth-date 1995-10-29;
  $user-2 isa user,
    has id "u0002",
    has name "Cameron Osborne",
    has birth-date 1954-11-11;
  $user-3 isa user,
    has id "u0003",
    has name "Keyla Pineda";
  $order-1 isa order,
    has id "o0001",
    has timestamp 2022-08-03T19:51:24.324,
    has status "canceled";
  $order-2 isa order,
    has id "o0002",
    has timestamp 2021-04-27T05:02:39.672,
    has status "dispatched";
  $order-6 isa order,
    has id "o0006",
    has timestamp 2020-08-19T20:21:54.194,
    has status "paid";
  (order: $order-1, buyer: $user-1) isa purchase;
  (order: $order-2, buyer: $user-1) isa purchase;
  (order: $order-6, buyer: $user-2) isa purchase;
----
. Click the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[Run Query] button.
. When the query has completed, click image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit Transaction].

The data should now be persisted in the database, and is ready to be queried.

== Read data

Let's retrieve some details for orders that are currently dispatched. The following Fetch query matches any dispatched orders, and returns the order timestamp, order status, and the name of the buyer. Using a `data` session and `read` transaction, image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[run] this query.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $order has status "dispatched";
  (order: $order, buyer: $buyer) isa purchase;
fetch
  $order: timestamp, status;
  $buyer: name;
----

== Update data

To update data in a database, we match the existing data, delete it, and then insert new data to replace it. The following Update query updates the status of the order with ID "o0006". Using a `data` session and `write` transaction, image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[run] this query, then image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[commit] the transaction.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $order-6 isa order,
    has id "o0006",
    has status $old-status;
delete
  $order-6 has $old-status;
insert
  $order-6 has status "dispatched";
----

After committing the transaction, the updated information is persisted in the database and becomes available for querying. If we then re-run the above Fetch query, we should see the results have updated to reflect the change.
