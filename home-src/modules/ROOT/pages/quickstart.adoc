This Quickstart guide shows how to set up a TypeDB database and run queries using
xref:manual::studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio].

include::home::overview.adoc[tag=rust-rewrite]

== Run TypeDB

To start TypeDB, select the TypeDB edition below and follow the instructions.

[tabs]
====
Cloud::
+
--
// tag::cloud-run[]
Log in to https://cloud.typedb.com/[TypeDB Cloud,window=_blank] and create a new deployment on the Deployments page.
// end::cloud-run[]

// tag::self-hosted-run[]
For self-hosted TypeDB Cloud installation and setup,
see the xref:install/cloud-self-hosted.adoc[Self-hosted deployment] page.
// end::self-hosted-run[]
--

Core::
+
--
TypeDB Core needs to be xref:home::install/core.adoc[installed] first.

[#_typedb_studio]
== Connect to TypeDB
// tag::run_studio[]
There are several ways to connect to a running TypeDB server. In this quickstart guide we will use *TypeDB Studio*, a standalone TypeDB Client with GUI that needs to be
xref:home::install/studio.adoc[installed] and launched separately from a TypeDB server.

Find the TypeDB Studio binary and run it.
Click btn:[Connect to TypeDB] on the right side of the top toolbar.
// end::run_studio[]
include::manual::studio.adoc[tag=connect_studio]

=== Select a project folder

To enable TypeDB Studio's IDE functionality, you now need to select a project folder to store your project files. Select a xref:manual::studio.adoc#_select_a_project_directory[project folder]
by clicking either btn:[Open Project] in the *Project* panel or
image:home::studio-icons/project.png[] Open Project Directory button in the top toolbar.

[#_create_a_database]
== Create a new database

Create a database to play with:

. Click the database icon (image:home::studio-icons/database.png[]) in the top toolbar.
. Enter a name for a new database, for example, `typedb-1`, and click btn:[Create].
. Select the new database from the dropdown to the right of the database icon.

[#_define_a_schema]
== Define a schema

A new database needs a schema before we can load any data:

. Ensure the Session toggle (`schema` / `data`) is set to `schema` and
  the Transaction toggle (`write` / `read`) is set to `write`.
. Open a new tab and copy-paste the following Define query:
+
[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$crash-course-schema.tql[]
----
. Click the image:home::studio-icons/run.png[Run query,width=9 query,width=9] btn:[Run Query] button.
. When the query has completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]).

Now that the schema has been defined, data can be inserted into the database.

[#_load_data]
== Load data

Now let's insert some sample data into the newly created database to be able to query in future steps:

. Ensure the Session toggle is set to `data` and the Transaction toggle is set to `write`.
. Open a new tab and copy-paste the following Insert queries:
+
[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$crash-course-data.tql[]
----
. Execute all queries in the file by clicking the image:home::studio-icons/svg/play-solid-green.svg[Run query,width=9]
btn:[Run Query] button.
. When the queries have completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction] (image:home::studio-icons/commit.png[]).

Assuming there were no errors in the process, the data is persisted in the database.

== Finish

Congratulations on completing the TypeDB quickstart guide!
Now you can try sending your first queries to the database.

To learn about TypeDB's advanced and unique features such as
polymorphic queries,
type inference,
type inheritance,
rule-based reasoning,
and n-ary relations, we recommend you check the <<_learn_more>> section.
