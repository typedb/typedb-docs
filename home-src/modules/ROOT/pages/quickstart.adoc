This Quickstart guide shows how to set up a TypeDB database and run queries using
xref:manual::studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio].

[#_define_a_schema]
== Define a schema

A new database needs a schema before we can load any data:

. Ensure the session type toggle (image:manual::icons/session-schema.png[]) is set to `schema` and the transaction type toggle (image:manual::icons/transaction-write.png[]) is set to `write`.
. Open a image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_new.svg[width=24] btn:[New Tab] in the btn:[Text Editor] and paste in the following Define query.

[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$crash-course-schema.tql[]
----
. Click the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[Run Query] button.
. When the query has completed, click image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit Transaction].

With the schema defined, we can now insert data into the database.

[#_load_data]
== Load data

Let's insert sample data for our newly defined schema:

. Ensure the session toggle is set to `data` and the transaction toggle is set to `write`.
. Open a new tab and paste in the following Insert query.
+
[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$crash-course-data.tql[]
----
. Click the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[Run Query] button.
. When the query has completed, click image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit Transaction].

The data should now be persisted in the database, and is ready to be queried.

== Read data

Let's send a Fetch query to retrieve all types of action permitted for a particular user on a particular file. Using a `data` session and `read` transaction, image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[run] the following query.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $bob isa user, has name "Bob";
  $readme isa file, has path "docs/quickstart-guide.adoc";
  (subject: $bob, object: $readme, action: $action) isa permission;
fetch
  $action: name;
----

This query matches permissions of users with the name "Bob" for files with the path "docs/quickstart-guide.adoc". This is represented by a `permission` relation in which the user plays the `subject` role and the file plays the `object` role. For any matched permissions, it fetches the name of permitted action.

== Update data

To update data in a database, we match the existing data, delete it, and then insert new data to replace it. Let's update Bob's permissions for the quickstart guide documentation. Using a `data` session and `write` transaction, image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[run] the following query, then image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[commit] the transaction.

[,typeql]
----
match
  $guide isa file, has path "docs/quickstart-guide.adoc";
  $bob isa user, has name "Bob";
  $read isa action, has name "read";
  $perm (object: $guide, subject: $bob, action: $read) isa permission,
    has updated $date;
  $write isa action, has name "write";
delete
  $perm (action: $read);
  $perm has $date;
insert
  $perm (action: $write);
  $perm has updated 2024-05-15T11:04:36;
----

This query matches `permission` relation by its roleplayers, removes the "read" action from playing `action` role, and replaces it with the "write" action. It also replaces the `updated` attribute to record the update to Bob's permissions.

After committing the transaction, the updated information is persisted in the database and becomes available for querying. If we then re-run the above Fetch query, we should see the results have updated to reflect the change.
