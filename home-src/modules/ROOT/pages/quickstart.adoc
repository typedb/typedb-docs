This Quickstart guide shows how to set up a TypeDB database and run queries.

== Prerequisites

. xref:home::install.adoc#_install[Install TypeDB Core].
. xref:home::install.adoc#_studio[Install TypeDB Studio].

== Start TypeDB

To start a TypeDB Core server:

[,bash]
----
typedb server
----

To run TypeDB Core in a new Docker container:

[,bash]
----
docker run --name typedb -d -v typedb-data:/opt/ -p 1729:1729 --platform linux/amd64 vaticle/typedb:latest
----

[#_typedb_client]
== Run TypeDB Studio

xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc[TypeDB Studio] is a standalone TypeDB Client with GUI that needs to be
installed and launched separately from a TypeDB server.

To start TypeDB Studio, find the installed binary file and run it.

image::quickstart-studio.png[TypeDB Studio, width = 75%, link=self]

== Connect to TypeDB

TypeDB Studio needs a network connection to a TypeDB server to manage databases and send queries:

. Click btn:[Connect to TypeDB] on the right side of the toolbar.
. Enter TypeDB Core server address (e.g., `localhost:1729`) and click btn:[Connect].

== Select a project folder

Select a xref:clients:ROOT:studio.adoc#_open_a_project_directory[project directory]
to store project files by clicking either:

* btn:[Open Project] in the *Project* panel (upper left); or
* Folder icon (the first icon on the top toolbar).

[#_create_a_database]
== Create a new database

Create a database to play with:

. Click the database icon (the third button in the top toolbar).
+
image::studio-database.png[Database Manager button,width = 50%,link=self]
. Enter `try-studio` and click btn:[Create].
. Select `try-studio` from the database dropdown (to the right of the database icon).

[#_define_a_schema]
== Define a schema

A new database needs a schema before we can load any data:

. Open a new tab and copy-paste the following Define query:
+
[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$quickstart-schema.tql[]
----
. Ensure the Session toggle (`schema` / `data`) is set to `schema` and
  the Transaction toggle (`write` / `read`) is set to `write`.
. Click btn:[Run Query].
. When the query has completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction].

Now that the schema has been defined, data can be inserted into the database.

== Load data

Now let's insert some sample data into the newly created database to be able to query in future steps:

. Open a new tab and copy-paste the following Insert queries:
+
[,typeql]
----
include::attachment$quickstart-data.tql[]
----
. Ensure the Session toggle is set to `data` and the Transaction toggle is set to `write`.
. Execute all queries in the file by clicking btn:[Run Query].
. When the queries have completed, click btn:[Commit Transaction].

Assuming there were no errors in the process, the data is persisted in the database.

== Finish

Congratulations on completing the TypeDB quickstart guide!
Now you can try sending your first queries to the database.
We have prepared some simple <<_query_examples,query examples>> for you to try.

To learn about TypeDB's advanced and unique features such as
polymorphic queries,
type inference,
type inheritance,
rule-based reasoning,
and n-ary relations, we recommend you check the <<_learn_more>> section.
//#todo [TypeDB in 20 queries?]

[#_query_examples]
== Query examples

Try sending the following queries:

* <<#_get_query__list_people>>
* <<#_get_query__all_instances_and_attributes>>
* <<#_get_query__get_all_emails_of_kevin>>
* <<#_insert_query__add_a_new_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_update_query__change_the_newly_added_email_for_kevin>>
* <<#_delete_query__delete_ownership_of_the_newly_updated_email_from_kevin>>

//#todo Replace the link below with a more specific one in a TypeQL section. Query types?
For more TypeQL query examples, check the xref:typeql:ROOT:overview.adoc[TypeQL] documentation.
//#todo Add the TypeDB in 20 queries page link

[#_get_query__list_people]
=== Get a list of all people with their emails

To xref:typedb::development/read.adoc#_get[get] all instances of a `person` type with their full names and emails:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name $f,
    has email $e;
get $p, $f, $e;
----

[#_get_query__all_instances_and_attributes]
=== Get all instances of a type with all attributes owned

To xref:typedb::development/read.adoc#_get[get] all instances of a `person` type with all attributes owned:

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has $a;
get $p, $a;
----

[#_get_query__get_all_emails_of_kevin]
=== Get all emails of Kevin

To xref:typedb::development/read.adoc#_get[get] all emails owned by every person with a full name that contains "Kevin"
(we have only one such person in the example database):

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name $fn;
$fn contains "Kevin";
$p has email $e;
get $e;
----

[#_insert_query__add_a_new_email_for_kevin]
=== Insert a new email for Kevin

To xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_insert[insert] a new email (`kevin@gmail.com`) for every person with a full name
that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name $fn;
$fn contains "Kevin";
insert $p has email "kevin@gmail.com";
----

Now Kevin has more than one email.

[#_update_query__change_the_newly_added_email_for_kevin]
=== Update the email for Kevin

To xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_update_query[update] the email from `kevin@gmail.com` to `kevin2@gmail.com`
for every person with a full name that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name $fn,
    has email $e;
$fn contains "Kevin";
$e = "kevin@gmail.com";
delete $p has $e;
insert $p has email "kevin2@gmail.com";
----

The query above does the following:

- Matches the person and its email (`kevin@gmail.com`).
- Deletes the ownership by the person of the email.
- Inserts a new email (`kevin2@gmail.com`) owned by the person.

[#_delete_query__delete_ownership_of_the_newly_updated_email_from_kevin]
=== Delete ownership over the email for Kevin

To xref:typedb::development/write.adoc#_delete_query[delete] the ownership of the email `kevin2@gmail.com`
for every person with a full name that contains "Kevin":

[,typeql]
----
match
$p isa person,
    has full-name $fn,
    has email $e;
$fn contains "Kevin";
$e = "kevin2@gmail.com";
delete $p has $e;
----

== Repeat with TypeDB Console

xref:clients:ROOT:console.adoc[TypeDB Console] is usually distributed with TypeDB.
You can find it with the TypeDB installed or xref:home::install.adoc#_console[install] it separately.

[#_console_run]
=== Run TypeDB Console

[,bash]
----
typedb console
----

[#_console_connect]

[,bash]
----
database create try-console
----

[#_console_define_a_schema]

+
[,bash]
----
transaction try-console schema write
----
. Run query:

----
+
Press btn:[Enter] twice to send the query.
. Commit:
+
[,bash]
----
commit
----

[#_console_load_data]
=== Load data
