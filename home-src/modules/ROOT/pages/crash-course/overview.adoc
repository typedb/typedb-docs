== Running queries

To run a query:

. Make sure you are using the correct *session type* and *transaction type*. You can change these using the session type toggle (image:manual::icons/session-schema.png[]) and transaction type toggle (image:manual::icons/transaction-write.png[]) in the top toolbar. The course material will tell you which session and transaction type to use for each query, but you can also refer to the following table.
+
[cols="^.^,^.^,^.^",caption="",options="header"]
|===
| Session type | Transaction type | Query types
| `schema` | `write` | Define
| `data` | `write` | Insert, Delete, Update
| `data` | `read` | Fetch, Get
|===

. Open a image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_new.svg[width=24] btn:[New Tab] in the btn:[Text Editor] and paste in the query.
. Click the image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_run.svg[width=24] btn:[Run Query] button.
. If the transaction is a `write` transaction: when the query has completed, click image:home::studio-icons/svg/studio_check.svg[width=24] btn:[Commit Transaction]. The course material will tell you when this is necessary.
