:summary: A birds-eye view of all documentation for TypeDB, TypeQL, and TypeDB Clients

Welcome to the TypeDB, TypeQL and TypeDB Clients technical documentation.

// tag::rust-rewrite[]
[NOTE]
====
TypeDB & TypeQL are in the process of being rewritten in https://www.rust-lang.org[Rust,window=_blank].
There will be significant refinement to the language, and minor breaks in backwards compatibility.
Learn about the changes on our https://github.com/vaticle/typedb/issues/6764[roadmap issue on GitHub,window=_blank].
The biggest change to TypeDB 3.0 will be our storage data structure and architecture
that significantly boosts performance.
We’re aiming to release 3.0 in the summer this year, along with preliminary benchmarks of TypeDB.
