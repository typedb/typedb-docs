## Introduction

Creating a client for our chosen language is straightforward! This page is a guide for the components and
protocols that need to be implemented.

A TypeDB client fundamentally is a lightweight frontend to the TypeDB server. Almost all operations are actually
handled on the server, and executed via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). So, to get started, we'll need to confirm
that gRPC and the underlying [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) messages support our language of choice.
Many languages also have non-official support for these protocols. Finally, we need to double check for compatible language versions.

## Depend on TypeDB gRPC and Protobuf Definitions
For development purposes, it may be sufficient to manually compile and copy-paste TypeDB's 
[protobuf definitions](https://github.com/vaticle/protocol). 

A more reliable method is to stay in sync with protocol changes via a package manager.
TypeDB's build system is [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), and offers one approach. If we'd would like to use a different package manager, 
the TypeDB team may also be able to help by setting up a distribution channel for our chosen language's compiled protobuf files.
In this case, please get in touch!

_This guide is a work in progress and will be updated with further details soon._
