  java: |
    The transaction query options object `Transaction.Options` can be used to override the default server behaviour
    query processing.

    The server defaults are:
    - `infer = true`
    - `explain = false`
    - `parallel = true`
    - `batchSize = 50`
    - `traceInference = false`

  python: |
    The transaction query optional parameters can be used to override the default server behaviour for query processing.

    The server defaults are:
    - `infer = True`
    - `explain = False`
    - `parallel = True`
    - `batch_size = 50`
    - `traceInference = False`

    `batch_size` tells the server to pre-compute and stream this number of answers at a time. These are buffered in the
    client until read. A larger batch size causes the server to compute more answers at a time, blocking the transaction
    until the batch is computed. Use `Transaction.Options.BATCH_ALL` to retrieve all answers from the server
    with a single client-side request.

  javascript: |
    The transaction query options Object can be used to override the default server behaviour for query processing.
    We can provide any of the allowed keys: `infer`, `explain`, and `batchSize`.

    The server defaults are:
    - `infer = true`
    - `explain = false`
    - `parallel = true`
    - `batchSize = 50`
    - `traceInference = false`

    `batchSize` tells the server to pre-compute and stream this number of answers at a time. These are buffered in the
    client until read. A larger batch size causes the server to compute more answers at a time, blocking the transaction
    until the batch is computed. Use `batchSize : "all"` to retrieve all answers from the server  with a single
    client-side request.
